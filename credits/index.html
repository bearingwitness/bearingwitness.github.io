<p>Samuel Kelton Roberts, PhD, is Associate Professor of <a href="http://history.columbia.edu/"><span class="underline">History</span></a>, <a href="http://www.mailman.columbia.edu/academic-departments/sociomedical-sciences"><span class="underline">Sociomedical Sciences</span></a>, and <a href="https://afamstudies.columbia.edu/"><span class="underline">African-American and African Diaspora Studies</span></a>, and is also a former Director of Columbia University’s <a href="http://www.iraas.com/"><span class="underline">Institute for Research in African American Studies</span></a> (IRAAS). Dr. Roberts writes, teaches, and lectures widely on African-American urban history, especially medicine, public health, and science and technology. His widely acclaimed book, <a href="http://www.uncpress.unc.edu/browse/book_detail?title_id=1587"><span class="underline"><em> Infectious Fear: Politics, Disease, and the Health Effects of Segregation</em></span></a> (University of North Carolina Press, 2009), is an exploration of the political economy of race and the modern American public health state between the late nineteenth century and the mid-twentieth century, a period which encompasses the overlapping and mutually-informed eras of Jim Crow segregation and modern American public health practice.</p>
<p>Roberts currently is researching and writing a book-length project on the United States’s troubled history of race and recovery, examining the social and political history of heroin addiction treatment from the 1950s to the early 1990s. This project traces urban policy at the beginning of the postwar heroin epidemic, the emergence of therapeutic communities, the politics of state-run addiction rehabilitation facilities, the racial politics of methadone maintenance treatment in the 1960s and 1970s, the emergence of “radical recovery” movements, and harm reduction and syringe exchange in the 1980s and 1990s.</p>
<p>In 2013-14, Dr. Roberts was the Policy Director of Columbia University’s newly inaugurated Justice Initiative (now the Columbia University Center for Justice) and was the editor of the Center’s first research publication <a href="https://www.issuelab.org/resource/aging-in-prison-reducing-elder-incarceration-and-promoting-public-safety.html"><span class="underline"><em> Aging in Prison: Reducing Elder Incarceration and Promoting Public Safety</em></span></a> (2015). At the Columbia University Center for Science and Society, he leads the Research Cluster for the <a href="https://scienceandsociety.columbia.edu/content/research-cluster-historical-study-race-inequality-and-health"><span class="underline">Historical Study of Race, Inequality, and Health</span></a>. He also is the co-editor of <a href="https://cup.columbia.edu/series/race-inequality-and-health"><span class="underline">Columbia University Press’s book series in Race, Inequality, and Health</span></a>. In 2018, Dr. Roberts launched the podcast series <a href="https://www.pdinterestingstuff.com/"><span class="underline"><em> People Doing Interesting Stuff (PDIS)</em></span></a> (available on <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/pdis/id1189321184?mt=2"><span class="underline">iTunes</span></a> and other podcasting platforms) in which he speaks with people working in public health and social justice, especially harm reduction, HIV/AIDS work, reproductive justice, and criminal justice reform. He is also the co-host of the podcast series, <em>Black Lives: In the Era of COVID-19</em>.</p>

</div>

<br>

<p>Prior to Columbia, Valentina studied anthropology and immunobiology at Brown University where she received her BA and MS degrees. While at Brown University, she worked in the Rhode Island Hospital Surgical Research Department for several years studying the immune response and the role of cell surface receptors in combating fungal pathogens. This research experience and her continued interest in anthropology led her to the field of public health. In May 2017, she graduated from the Mailman School of Public Health with her MPH degree in Sociomedical Sciences and a certificate in health and human rights. She became increasingly interested in historical methods and the intersection of health and the environment during her time at Mailman and following her MPH, she worked as a Program Officer in the Population and Family Health Department where she engaged in collaborative research projects concerning environmental and gender justice, forced migration and health, and plural legal systems. She rejoined the Sociomedical Sciences Department in fall 2018 as a doctoral student. Her doctoral research interests include the history of domestic environmental health and policy; shifting environmental risk perceptions and characterizations during the twentieth century; and health social movements related to the environmental threats, such as toxic exposures and climate change.</p>
