  abstract = {Session 18 \textendash{} Health Inequities: Addressing the Disease Burden in Black, Indigenous, and People of Color Communities In the United States, the novel coronavirus has disproportionately impacted Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities. Existing data shows that people in these communities are more likely to contract COVID-19 and are at higher risk of being hospitalized or dying from the disease. For example, while Black people make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, they account for 24 percent of COVID-19 deaths where race is known (COVID-19 Tracking Project). Disparities also exist among Latinx, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Pacific Islander populations. These disparities can be linked to a number of complex and interrelated issues, including limited access to medical services, socioeconomic disadvantages, and the effects of structural inequities and discrimination. During this webinar, speakers will examine the following learning goals: The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities in the U.S.; the drivers of these disparities; and short- and long-term policy options to advance equity and improve COVID-19 outcomes Panelists: Adaeze Enekwechi, Ph.D., MPP, President, IMPAQ, LLC Rachel Hardeman, Ph.D., MPH, Associate Professor, University of Minnesota School of Public Health Wizdom Powell, Ph.D., MPH, Director, Health Disparities Institute, UConn Health Laurie Zephyrin, M.D., MPH, MBA, Vice President, Delivery System Reform, The Commonwealth Fund (moderator)},

The coronavirus, also known as COVID-19, has impacted thousands around the world. Between the histories of xenophobic racism; medical experimentation and surveillance; prejudice in (and out) of the public health system; the violence of white capitalist heteronormative patriarchal supremacy and more, Asian-American and Black communities are disproportionately experiencing the detrimental impacts of the virus. In New York and across the nation, there is an increase of xenophobic racism and violence against Asian-Americans. Recent reports have shown that in states and cities such as Louisiana, Chicago, Milwaukee, and Michigan that the majority of those who are infected and dying from the coronavirus are Black. While there are well-documented tensions between Black and Asian-American communities, there is an equally long history of Black and Asian solidarities and community building both in the United States and abroad. How can Asian-American feminists and Black feminists engage in a critical dialogue on the impacts of COVID-19 in their respective communities? What can we learn from the long history of solidarity between Black and Asian-American feminists? More importantly, how can we continue to create transnational Black and Asian feminist solidarities in the United States and beyond?  Black Women Radicals and the Asian-American Feminist Collective had a critical discussion on these topics in efforts to continue to build cross-racial feminist solidarities.    Panelists from the Asian-American Feminist Collective included: Rachel Kuo (@\_kuolabear), Salonee Bhaman (@salonee), Tiffany Diane Tso (@tiffanydian), Julie Kim (@jakets), Senti Sojwal (@senti\_naro).

Noting the ways in which the centrality racial police violence has taken a back seat to COVID-19, Taylor emphasizes the way, "People refuse to have a structural analysis." She continues, noting how the social welfare state is broken: "Police departments believe they will never be touched by the logic of austerity." She points out that while every other part of the state is defunded, the police remain impervious, and thus see themselves as the last resort of public policy, to maintaining public order.},

Kliff notes that the hospital system lost a lot of money due to delayed care during the pandemic and will be tracking how hospitals deal with that, or face closure.

Kendi describes how in early April of 2020, few states had released racial data as it pertained to the COVID-19 virus. He, his colleagues, and other researchers and journalists across the United States then began calling on states to report this data, and Kendi and his team began tracking it via this project. Kendi, when asked in the interview about the media attention COVID-19 has received in the United Sates, explained that, contrary to the conventional wisdom proffered in March that the virus would be the great equalizer, affecting all demographics, his research showed that it was Latinx, Black, and Native American populations, in particular, that were and have been affected most by COVID-19. In Alaska, for instance, where Alaska Natives make up 14\% of the population, they have seen 38\% of the death related to the virus. Nationally, we have lost 38,438 Black lives (as of 2020/9/19) to COVID-19, accounting for 21\% of the deaths nationwide where race is known, despite the Black population making up roughly 13\% of the national population.},

These vulnerable communities are at the frontline of any global crisis, including the climate emergency.  This is a recording of a webinar hosted by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) on 2 July 2020, that saw speakers working with social movements and grassroots organisations examine how organisations are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and what we can learn. The speakers reviewed inequalities in impacts and coping strategies, and discussed mechanisms to address inequality and manage future risks and shocks. *How do we make room for innovation?  *How do we become more accepting of risk and increased experimentation?  *And what we can learn that will help us tackle the climate crisis? This was the second online event in a series hosted by IIED and ICCCAD on the climate crisis and COVID-19 - working together for the change we need which will be hosted between June and October 2020. This event was also hosted working in partnership with ICCCAD and Global Resilience Partnership (GRP) and was also a part of the London Climate Action Week series of online events. The speakers were: Sheela Patel, the founder and director of the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres (SPARC) India, which is based in Mumbai, and works in partnership with the National Slum Dweller Federation and Mahila Milan; Martha Chen, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and international coordinator of the global research-policy-action network Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO); Suranjana Gupta, advisor on Community Resilience at the Huairou Commission, a global coalition focused on grassroots women-led development; and Tracy Kajumba, principal researcher in IIED's Climate Change research group. The discussion was facilitated by Saleemul Huq, director of ICCCAD in Bangladesh, and an expert on the links between climate change and sustainable development, particularly from the perspective of developing countries.

Asked about systemic racial injustices and COVID, Fauci noted his time working at the outset of the AIDS epidemic. He noted African Americans made up 13\% of the U.S. population, but 44\% of the infections at the time. There is a similar disproportionate rate of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, Dr. Fauci noted that Black, Latinx, Indigenous and other minority demographics in America have two things going against them: First, a greater likelihood to contract coronavirus by the very nature of jobs prevalent in minority communities. Second, a higher rate of comorbidities, which leads to a higher susceptibility of hospitalization and death. Fauci highlighted how the latter, especially, is due to social determinants of health that many people are born in to. The answer to this, as COVID-19 has shed a bright light on social determinants of health that are essentially killing people, he concluded, is systemic change. Dr. Fauci was also asked about an equitable distribution of any COVID-19 vaccine that is developed. He referenced the CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, as well as the federal Panel, the National Academies', efforts in coming up with a just framework for distribution.}

Malik details that, as COVID-19 disproportionately affected people along racial lines (via high representation as essential labor, and also access or lack of access to health care) it became clear that the mobilization of black and ethnic minorities based in part on identity was necessary. Race is inextricable from class, Malik expands, disproving any claim that identity politics is the ``indulgence'' of the youth or woke culture. Malik's final thesis posits that the reason these myths exist is that the system is actually very weak. Myths of exceptionalism serve a purpose and obfuscate the broken or insufficient systems within these two states.},

  abstract = {Dr. Anthony Fauci, the United States' Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, was interviewed by the Yale Institute for Global Health. When asked for a status update for COVID-19 in America at the outset of the interview, Dr. Fauci tracked the beginning of the pandemic with its initial outbreak in the New York metropolitan area, after which the daily new case rate dropped to around 20 thousand a day. At that point the United States created a reopening framework with stages, however different states upheld these guidelines in varying manners. The nation then hit a spike of 70 thousand cases a day before plateauing at 40 thousand where the pandemic stuck for about a month. With the colder months approaching, we are now seeing our highest rate of cases yet, with 83 thousand this weekend. According to Dr. Fauci, "Unfortunately, we're right now in the middle of what's going to be referred to...as the mother of all outbreaks over the last hundred years."}
