In response to this alarming fact, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) are hosting a virtual conversation to dive into why this is happening, what resources are needed, and what people can do to cope and stay healthy in this midst of this public health crisis.},

To support their claims, some prisoners have used contraband cell phones that have been smuggled into prisons to post videos on Facebook and other social media sites. 

VICE News contacted one of the prisoners, 34-year-old Aaron Campbell, held at a federal prison in Ohio, who said he was punished for making his video by being sent to solitary confinement. In a letter, Campbell said officials told him he would not face additional discipline if he issued a statement saying the video was fake. He refused. (The BOP did not respond to questions about his allegations.)

	abstract = {COVID-19 has demonstrated stark social and economic inequalities, with vulnerable and marginalised groups being disproportionately impacted. These vulnerable communities are at the frontline of any global crisis, including the climate emergency. 

This is a recording of a webinar hosted by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) on 2 July 2020, that saw speakers working with social movements and grassroots organisations examine how organisations are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and what we can learn.

The speakers reviewed inequalities in impacts and coping strategies, and discussed mechanisms to address inequality and manage future risks and shocks.

*How do we make room for innovation? 
*How do we become more accepting of risk and increased experimentation? 
*And what we can learn that will help us tackle the climate crisis?

This was the second online event in a series hosted by IIED and ICCCAD on the climate crisis and COVID-19 - working together for the change we need which will be hosted between June and October 2020. This event was also hosted working in partnership with ICCCAD and Global Resilience Partnership (GRP) and was also a part of the London Climate Action Week series of online events.

The speakers were: Sheela Patel, the founder and director of the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres (SPARC) India, which is based in Mumbai, and works in partnership with the National Slum Dweller Federation and Mahila Milan; Martha Chen, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and international coordinator of the global research-policy-action network Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO); Suranjana Gupta, advisor on Community Resilience at the Huairou Commission, a global coalition focused on grassroots women-led development; and Tracy Kajumba, principal researcher in IIED's Climate Change research group.

The discussion was facilitated by Saleemul Huq, director of ICCCAD in Bangladesh, and an expert on the links between climate change and sustainable development, particularly from the perspective of developing countries.

	abstract = {Linda Rae Murray, MD, MPH discusses topics in health equity with JAMA Medical News Associate Managing Editor Jennifer Abbasi. Recorded on June 19, 2020.

Topics discussed in this interview:
0:00 Background on Dr Murray
0:51 So, in the U.S., African-Americans account for 13\% of the population,  but 24\% of COVID-19 deaths where race is known. And Blacks, Latinos, and American Indians also represent a disproportionate number of cases.  Can you talk to us about some of the many factors that are driving these numbers? 
4:31 Something that has been discussed is that the idea of working from home, which is something  that I have the opportunity to do, is a privilege for a lot of people,  and a privilege that a lot of people don't have.
5:49 Researchers are looking into possible associations between air pollution,  which we know communities of color have higher exposures to, and COVID-19 susceptibility severity.  Do you think it could be a factor?  
7:30 Has enough been done to get information about COVID-19 out to minority communities,  including the African-American community?
10:11 Do you think that the messaging has improved and that more people are being reached now?  
11:56 Do you have any idea where this myth arose that black people can't get COVID-19? 
14:31 What about distrust of the medical establishment in the black community?  Can you talk to us about whether you feel like that's had a bearing on the COVID-19 pandemic?
17:24 Are you concerned about -- when we do have a vaccine --  if it will be available for minority communities?
19:16 Of the first 100 people in Chicago to die from COVID-19, 70 of them were black. They didn't have faith in some of the lower resource safety net hospitals  in their neighborhoods, so they waited to go to the hospital until it was too late. What are your thoughts about that?
21:28 What do you think about the lack of demographic data that we've been experiencing?  
23:18 Are we do -- doing better  in collecting demographic data -- data on COVID-19 at this point?  
24:58 An estimated 1 in 1,000 black men in the U.S. will be killed by police over the course  of their lifetimes, according to data. As a physician, how do you think about this in the context of keeping communities healthy?
28:44 So, you have said, Dr. Murray, that you are devoting the rest  of your career to being an enthusiastic full time troublemaker.  So, what does that mean for you?},

	abstract = {On April 24, 2020, the National Minority Quality Forum hosted a webinar on mental health during COVID-19.  There are many campaigns and public service announcements that emphasize the importance of taking care of one’s mental health.  Up until recently, seeking help for a mental health condition was highly stigmatized in many communities across the United States, especially in minority communities.  If left unaddressed, uncertainty and fear about coronavirus have the potential to exacerbate existing mental health conditions and amplify the stress and anxiety that accompany our new daily living norms.  This webinar will address questions and concerns regarding mental health maintenance during the COVID-19 pandemic.

	abstract = {Session 18 – Health Inequities: Addressing the Disease Burden in Black, Indigenous, and People of Color Communities

In the United States, the novel coronavirus has disproportionately impacted Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities. Existing data shows that people in these communities are more likely to contract COVID-19 and are at higher risk of being hospitalized or dying from the disease. For example, while Black people make up about 13 percent of the U.S. population, they account for 24 percent of COVID-19 deaths where race is known (COVID-19 Tracking Project). Disparities also exist among Latinx, American Indian, Alaskan Native, and Pacific Islander populations. These disparities can be linked to a number of complex and interrelated issues, including limited access to medical services, socioeconomic disadvantages, and the effects of structural inequities and discrimination.

During this webinar, speakers will examine the following learning goals:
The disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities in the U.S.; the drivers of these disparities; and short- and long-term policy options to advance equity and improve COVID-19 outcomes

The pandemic has illuminated the struggles minority populations have in obtaining good information, getting tested, and finding help when infected. But the two health experts say there are ways to improve the situation.

Drs. Thomas and Fayanju spoke to and took questions from media members on July 9, 2020.

Faculty participants:
- Dr. Oluwadamilola “Lola” Fayanju is an assistant professor of surgery and population health sciences in the Duke School of Medicine, director of the Durham VA Breast Clinic, and associate director for disparities and value in health care with Duke Forge, the university’s center for data science. Her research includes variants of breast cancer that are often more common among racial and ethnic minorities.

- Dr. Kevin Thomas is an associate professor in the Division of Cardiovascular Disease at the Duke School of Medicine, where he is also assistant dean for underrepresented faculty development and co-director of the Duke Health Disparities Research Curriculum. Thomas is also director of health disparities research and faculty diversity at the Duke Clinical Research Institute.},

At least 28 people are infected, and 22 corrections staff have tested positive. State corrections officials are sending infected prisoners to the Louisiana State Penitentiary — known as Angola, the largest maximum-security prison in the United States — where they are being held in Camp J, a notorious part of the prison that was shut down in 2018 because of inhumane treatment.  The ACLU of Louisiana sued to stop the statewide transfer of COVID-19 patients to Angola prison, but a judge denied the request last Thursday. We speak with Alanah Odoms Hebert, executive director of the ACLU of Louisiana, and Albert Woodfox, who served the longest time in solitary confinement of any prisoner in the United States — 44 years in Angola prison.

Young responds that it is the inequities in America that have been with us for generations, if not centuries, that have made our body politic such an opportunistic target. He says, "Water running along a pavement will readily seep into every crack. So, too, did the unchecked coronavirus seep into every fault line in the modern world."

Malik details that, as COVID-19 disproportionately affected people along racial lines (via high representation as essential labor, and also access or lack of access to health care) it became clear that the mobilization of black and ethnic minorities based in part on identity was necessary. Race is inextricable from class, Malik expands, disproving any claim that identity politics is the “indulgence” of the youth or woke culture. Malik’s final thesis posits that the reason these myths exist is that the system is actually very weak. Myths of exceptionalism serve a purpose and obfuscate the broken or insufficient systems within these two states.},

Noting the ways in which the centrality racial police violence has taken a back seat to COVID-19, Taylor emphasizes the way, "People refuse to have a structural analysis." She continues, noting how the social welfare state is broken: "Police departments believe they will never be touched by the logic of austerity." She points out that while every other part of the state is defunded, the police remain impervious, and thus see themselves as the last resort of public policy, to maintaining public order.},

	abstract = {In an interview with DemocracyNow, Dr. Ibram X. Kendi details the COVID Racial Data Tracking Project, a collaboration between the Altlantic and the Anti-racist Research and Policy Center at American Uniersity to track racial desparities occuring within the COVID-19 pandemic. Kendi describes how in early April of 2020, few states had released racial data as it pertained to the COVID-19 virus. He, his colleagues, and other researchers and journalists across the United States then began calling on states to report this data, and Kendi and his team began tracking it via this project. Kendi, when asked in the interview about the media attention COVID-19 has received in the United Sates, explained that, contrary to the conventional wisdom proffered in March that the virus would be the great equalizer, affecting all demographics, his research showed that it was Latinx, Black, and Native American populations, in particular, that were and have been affected most by COVID-19. In Alaska, for instance, where Alaska Natives make up 14\% of the population, they have seen 38\% of the death related to the virus. Nationally, we have lost 38,438 Black lives (as of 2020/9/19) to COVID-19, accounting for 21\% of the deaths nationwide where race is known, despite the Black population making up roughly 13\% of the national population.},

Noting Oregon's choice not to alleviate health risks as much as possible in relation to COVID-19 within its carceral system, Chavez conveyed: "They were at a crossroads and chose to continue to mass incarcerate, and now we have this public health crisis...Prison is even more confined and compact than a nursing home or a cruise ship. The possibility that they're just going to catch this disease they were not sentenced to catch." Oregon Justice Resource Center is calling on Oregon and Governor Kate Brown to release more inmates to alleviate risk and improve conditions within the prison system. To date, 907 cases of COVID-19 among inmates and 230 cases among staff have been reported by the ODOC.},
