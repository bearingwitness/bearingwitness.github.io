Initial data on the racial and ethnic patterns of COVID-19 show that the pandemic is disproportionately impacting Black communities.

In response to this alarming fact, the American Medical Association (AMA) and the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) are hosting a virtual conversation to dive into why this is happening, what resources are needed, and what people can do to cope and stay healthy in this midst of this public health crisis.},

To support their claims, some prisoners have used contraband cell phones that have been smuggled into prisons to post videos on Facebook and other social media sites. 

VICE News contacted one of the prisoners, 34-year-old Aaron Campbell, held at a federal prison in Ohio, who said he was punished for making his video by being sent to solitary confinement. In a letter, Campbell said officials told him he would not face additional discipline if he issued a statement saying the video was fake. He refused. (The BOP did not respond to questions about his allegations.)

	abstract = {COVID-19 has demonstrated stark social and economic inequalities, with vulnerable and marginalised groups being disproportionately impacted. These vulnerable communities are at the frontline of any global crisis, including the climate emergency. 

This is a recording of a webinar hosted by the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED) and the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD) on 2 July 2020, that saw speakers working with social movements and grassroots organisations examine how organisations are responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, and what we can learn.

The speakers reviewed inequalities in impacts and coping strategies, and discussed mechanisms to address inequality and manage future risks and shocks.

*How do we make room for innovation? 
*How do we become more accepting of risk and increased experimentation? 
*And what we can learn that will help us tackle the climate crisis?

This was the second online event in a series hosted by IIED and ICCCAD on the climate crisis and COVID-19 - working together for the change we need which will be hosted between June and October 2020. This event was also hosted working in partnership with ICCCAD and Global Resilience Partnership (GRP) and was also a part of the London Climate Action Week series of online events.

The speakers were: Sheela Patel, the founder and director of the Society for the Promotion of Area Resource Centres (SPARC) India, which is based in Mumbai, and works in partnership with the National Slum Dweller Federation and Mahila Milan; Martha Chen, a lecturer in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School and international coordinator of the global research-policy-action network Women in Informal Employment: Globalizing and Organizing (WIEGO); Suranjana Gupta, advisor on Community Resilience at the Huairou Commission, a global coalition focused on grassroots women-led development; and Tracy Kajumba, principal researcher in IIED's Climate Change research group.

The discussion was facilitated by Saleemul Huq, director of ICCCAD in Bangladesh, and an expert on the links between climate change and sustainable development, particularly from the perspective of developing countries.

Topics discussed in this interview:
0:00 Background on Dr Murray
0:51 So, in the U.S., African-Americans account for 13\% of the population,  but 24\% of COVID-19 deaths where race is known. And Blacks, Latinos, and American Indians also represent a disproportionate number of cases.  Can you talk to us about some of the many factors that are driving these numbers? 
4:31 Something that has been discussed is that the idea of working from home, which is something  that I have the opportunity to do, is a privilege for a lot of people,  and a privilege that a lot of people don't have.
5:49 Researchers are looking into possible associations between air pollution,  which we know communities of color have higher exposures to, and COVID-19 susceptibility severity.  Do you think it could be a factor?  
7:30 Has enough been done to get information about COVID-19 out to minority communities,  including the African-American community?
10:11 Do you think that the messaging has improved and that more people are being reached now?  
11:56 Do you have any idea where this myth arose that black people can't get COVID-19? 
14:31 What about distrust of the medical establishment in the black community?  Can you talk to us about whether you feel like that's had a bearing on the COVID-19 pandemic?
17:24 Are you concerned about -- when we do have a vaccine --  if it will be available for minority communities?
19:16 Of the first 100 people in Chicago to die from COVID-19, 70 of them were black. They didn't have faith in some of the lower resource safety net hospitals  in their neighborhoods, so they waited to go to the hospital until it was too late. What are your thoughts about that?
21:28 What do you think about the lack of demographic data that we've been experiencing?  
23:18 Are we do -- doing better  in collecting demographic data -- data on COVID-19 at this point?  
24:58 An estimated 1 in 1,000 black men in the U.S. will be killed by police over the course  of their lifetimes, according to data. As a physician, how do you think about this in the context of keeping communities healthy?
28:44 So, you have said, Dr. Murray, that you are devoting the rest  of your career to being an enthusiastic full time troublemaker.  So, what does that mean for you?},

	abstract = {On April 24, 2020, the National Minority Quality Forum hosted a webinar on mental health during COVID-19.  There are many campaigns and public service announcements that emphasize the importance of taking care of one’s mental health.  Up until recently, seeking help for a mental health condition was highly stigmatized in many communities across the United States, especially in minority communities.  If left unaddressed, uncertainty and fear about coronavirus have the potential to exacerbate existing mental health conditions and amplify the stress and anxiety that accompany our new daily living norms.  This webinar will address questions and concerns regarding mental health maintenance during the COVID-19 pandemic.
