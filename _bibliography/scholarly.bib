  abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a novel coronavirus that was initially described in Wuhan China in December 2019. In the USA (US), the person to be diagnosed with the novel Coronavirus infection (COVID) was on 19 January 2020. On 18 March 2020, a 31-year-old morbidly obese African American woman presented with severe dyspnea with associated hypoxemia, fever and bilateral interstitial pulmonary ground glass infiltrates consistent with viral pneumonitis. Nasopharyngeal PCR testing was positive for SARS-CoV-2. Despite initiation of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin along with supplemental oxygen therapy, rapid disease progression consistent with cytokine release syndrome ensued, leading to initiation of mechanical ventilatory support. Anti-Interleukin (IL)-6 receptor monoclonal antibody (tocilizumab) was administered. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) leads to refractory hypoxemia and demise. Severe morbid obesity as well as race may be unidentified risk factors for the development of severe Illness in patients with COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Objectives: There is preliminary evidence of racial and social economic disparities in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health, and economic inequality in the United States.;  Methods: We performed an ecological study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population, 102,178,117 [median, 73,447; IQR, 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts).;  Results: The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher proportion with disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing.;  Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of racial, economic, and health inequality in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. These observations might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.},

The World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have released recommendations to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, including hand washing, covering coughs, and social/physical distancing, but what happens to those who are incarcerated? Over 1.4 million adults in the United States are currently incarcerated in state and federal prisons and over 80,000 individuals are incarcerated in local jails. Correctional settings are often deprived, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments, which do not lend themselves to the prevention, treatment, or recovery from illness. Incarcerated individuals are at a much higher risk to become infected due to a variety of factors, such as generally higher rates of chronic conditions than the community and overall lack of screening for certain illnesses. The present article discusses how smart decarceration tactics, such as compassionate release, offer options to compensate for overcrowding in correctional facilities and reducing the spread of COVID-19.},

This study aims to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in African American patients.METHODSThis was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of African American patients with COVID-19 treated between March 12 and April 9, 2020, at a single tertiary center. The primary outcome of interest was severe disease defined as those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.RESULTSThe study included 158 consecutive patients. The mean age was 57 years, and 61\% were women. The mean (SD) of BMI was 33.2 (8.6) kg/m2 . Overall, patients admitted to the ICU were older (62 vs. 55 years, P\,=\,0.003) and had higher BMI (36.5 kg/m2 vs. 31.9 kg/m2 , P\,=\,0.002). In unadjusted and adjusted analysis, the factors most associated with ICU admission in this sample were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.073; 95\% CI: 1.033-1.114), BMI (aOR: 1.115; 95\% CI: 1.052-1.182), and lung disease (aOR: 3.097; 95\% CI: 1.137-8.437).CONCLUSIONSThis study identified risk factors for severe disease in COVID-19, specifically in an African American population. Further inclusive research aimed at optimizing clinical care relevant to the African American population is critical to ensure an equitable response to COVID-19.},

The aim of this study was to determine whether disparities exist in the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) related to COVID-19.; Methods: We analyzed data from 1216 adults in the March 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation 'Coronavirus Poll', to determine levels of KAPs across different groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of KAPs.; Results: In contrast to White respondents, Non-White respondents were more likely to have low knowledge (58\% versus 30\%; P~{$<~$}0.001) and low attitude scores (52\% versus 27\%; P~{$<~$}0.001), but high practice scores (81\% versus 59\%; P~{$<~$}0.001). By multivariate regression, White race (odds ratio [OR] 3.06; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70-5.50), higher level of education (OR 1.80; 95\% CI: 1.46-2.23) and higher income (OR 2.06; 95\% CI: 1.58-2.70) were associated with high knowledge of COVID-19. Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status and political views were all associated with KAPs.; Conclusions: Racial and socioeconomic disparity exists in the levels of KAPs related to COVID-19. More work is needed to identify educational tools that tailor to specific racial and socioeconomic groups. (\textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter's integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January~1\textendash April~8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African American patients had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option. Our study provides real-world evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the presentation of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effects of large group meetings on the spread of COVID-19 by studying the impact of eighteen Trump campaign rallies. To capture the effects of subsequent contagion within the pertinent communities, our analysis encompasses up to ten post-rally weeks for each event. Our method is based on a collection of regression models, one for each event, that capture the relationships between post-event outcomes and pre-event characteristics, including demographics and the trajectory of COVID-19 cases, in similar counties. We explore a total of 24 procedures for identifying sets of matched counties. For the vast majority of these variants, our estimate of the average treatment effect across the eighteen events implies that they increased subsequent confirmed cases of COVID-19 by more than 250 per 100,000 residents. Extrapolating this figure to the entire sample, we conclude that these eighteen rallies ultimately resulted in more than 30,000 incremental confirmed cases of COVID-19. Applying countyspecific post-event death rates, we conclude that the rallies likely led to more than 700 deaths (not necessarily among attendees).},

Chronic conditions, especially diabetes, are comparatively common in African and South Asian minority groups in Europe and the USA.22 Stroke is more common in African populations in the UK and the USA, with moderate increased risk of coronary heart disease in South Asian groups compared with White populations.22 Other comorbidities including COPD, asthma, and infections such as tuberculosis might also be contributing to comparatively adverse outcomes in COVID-19. [...]the heterogeneity of ethnic/racial minority groups, whether African, Caribbean, South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi in the UK), Chinese, or other ethnicities, have diverse risk factor profiles, which might be important for COVID-19 outcomes.19,23 The high prevalence of chronic diseases in US and UK ethnic/racial minorities reflects social and economic disadvantages, and factors such as diet, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and exposure to psychosocial stressors.16,21,22 The effects of hostile environments against immigrants, particularly failed asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, might affect settled ethnic/racial minority populations adversely through heightened prejudice and societal tensions. The evidence in the UK and the USA in the time of COVID-19 has sharpened the focus on inequalities neglected for a long time.

As states begin to lift these orders to reopen the economy, the risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 may be related to the public's voluntary adherence to public health recommendations. We conducted a nationally representative survey of 604 African Americans to generate a risk assessment based on African Americans' compliance with public health recommendations to frequently wash hands, maintain social distancing, avoid touching face, and wear a mask in public. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive study of African Americans and public health adherence specific to COVID-19. The percent of respondents reporting that they always comply with these recommendations was 72\%, 67\%, 55\%, and 65\%, respectively. Based on this threshold, African Americans' level of adherence with COVID-19 public health recommendations suggests they may be at high risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 during reopening, and there is an urgent need for targeted, culturally responsive public health messaging that is accessible to communities of color to help address racial disparities in COVID-19 risk.

  abstract = {Black Lives Matter has been a major force for social change in the US since 2014, with social media playing a core role in the development and proliferation of the movement. The largest protests in US history occurred in late May and early June 2020, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. This incident reignited widespread support for the BLM movement. The protests were notable not only for their size but also that they occurred at a time the US was still struggling to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 20,000 new cases per day. With protest conditions and police crowd control tactics exacerbating disease spread and with COVID disproportionately affecting minority populations, it was hypothesised that participation in and support for the protests would involve a balancing act between the risks of systemic racism and of disease spread. However, social media data suggest that this was not the case, with discussion of the BLM movement replacing discussion of COVID on US social media. Neither supporters or opposers of the BLM movement or protest action mentioned COVID as a factor. Framings of the movement by BLM supporters largely replicated those of earlier studies, with new frames emerging surrounding the opposition the movement has received from racism, police militarisation and President Donald Trump. Discourse evidenced worrying levels of polarisation, hate, incivility and conspiracy content and bore many similarities to previously studied COVID discourse. This suggests that George Floyd's death, as yet another example of an African American man killed by US police, was largely seen through established, polarised identity positions that made reactions to the incident and resulting protest largely a foregone conclusion, established and articulated without reference to the ongoing pandemic.},

  abstract = {This commentary amplifies the insidious nature of the novel coronavirus (resulting in COVID19) and its ubiquitous spread, which disproportionately and adversely affect the health and well-being of people of color. The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught. The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field. This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus. For people of color to transcend the coronavirus pandemic crisis there must be comprehensive access to COVID-19 testing and early, sustained, and affordable access to health care, including hospitalization. Such access will require national leadership, which seems to be in short supply.},

Patients endured and frequently succumbed to a miserable illness, their suffering often made worse by the chaotic circumstances the epidemic produced in families and communities and shaped in significant and sometimes discriminatory ways by their gender, class, and race. While the nation's public culture soon forgot the epidemic, it lived on in lives changed irrevocably by its consequences.

Louisiana was one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic with just over 57,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the end of June 2020. We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during the peak of the pandemic, March 1st through March 31st, to document the type and frequency of neurological problems seen in patients with COVID-19 at presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. A large proportion of our sample (80 \%) was African American and had hypertension (79 \%). Out of 250 patients, 56 (22 \%) patients died, and 72 (29 \%) patients required intubation. Thirty-four (14 \%) had a neurological chief complaint at presentation; the most common neurological chief complaints in the entire sample were altered mental status (AMS) (8 \%), headache (2 \%), and syncope (2 \%). We used a competing risk model to determine whether neurological symptoms at presentation or during hospital stay were predictors of prolonged hospital stay and death. To establish whether neurological symptoms were associated with higher odds of intubation, we used logistic regression. Age was the only significant demographic predictor of death and hospital stay. The HR (95 \%CI) for remaining in the hospital for a ten-year increase in age was 1.2, (1.1, 1.3, p {$<$} 0.0001), and for death was 1.3, (1.1, 1.5, p {$<$} 0.01). There were no demographic characteristics, including age or comorbidities predictive of intubation. Adjusting for age, patients who at presentation had neurological issues as their chief complaint were at significantly increased risk for remaining in the hospital, HR = 1.7, (1.1,2.5, p = 0.0001), and dying, HR = 2.1(1.1,3.8, p = 0.02), compared to patients without any neurological complaint. Of the individual admission complaints, AMS was associated with a significantly prolonged hospital stay, HR = 1.8, (1.0-3.3, p = 0.05). Patients that required dialysis or intubation or had AMS during hospitalization had more extended hospital stays. After adjusting for age, dialysis, and intubation, patients with AMS during hospital stay had a HR of 1.6, (1.1, 2.5, p = 0.01) for remaining in the hospital. Patients who had statistically significant higher odds of requiring intubation were those who presented with any neurological chief complaint, OR = 2.8 (1.3,5.8, p = 0.01), or with headaches OR = 13.3 (2.1,257.0, p = 0.008). Patients with AMS during the hospital stay, as well as those who had seizures, were more likely to need intubation. In the multivariate model, dialysis, OR = 4.9 (2.6,9.4, p {$<$} 0.0001), and AMS, OR = 8.8 (3.9,21.2, p {$<$} 0.0001), were the only independent predictors of intubation. Neurological complaints at presentation and during the hospital stay are associated with a higher risk of death, prolonged hospital stay, and intubation. More work is needed to determine whether the cause of the neurological complaints was direct CNS involvement by the virus or the other systemic complications of the virus.

Interviews were conducted with 37 randomly selected participants from San Diego zip codes with the highest rate of COVID-19 infection. Almost every person interviewed named language as one of the largest barriers to adequate contact tracing. Notably, many participants also expressed concerns about the potential impact of contract tracing on immigration status, one interviewee stating, ````I wouldn't be comfortable sharing information with the city due to the fact that it is personal, and some people aren't comfortable speaking to authority/County because of their legal status. They are afraid to speak to them or even look for resources for that same reason.'' Also the report found that many households are supported by a single income with female interviewees describing explicitly the amount of ``care work they are responsible for to maintain their households.'' Solutions proposed by the report include linguistically and culturally relevant outreach for Spanish-speaking communities, transparent and proactive information regarding privacy concerns, and finally, structural solutions to barriers to isolation, which are also structural. ``Asking the sole wage-earner in a household to isolate could very likely precipitate a major financial crisis for an entire family.''},

  abstract = {The risk of severe COVID-19 if an individual becomes infected is known to be higher in older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and how this varies between countries should inform the design of possible strategies to shield or vaccinate those at highest risk. We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe disease (defined as those with at least one condition listed as "at increased risk of severe COVID-19" in current guidelines) by age (5-year age groups), sex, and country for 188 countries using prevalence data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 and UN population estimates for 2020. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 was determined by mapping the conditions listed in GBD 2017 to those listed in guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and the USA. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. To help interpretation of the degree of risk among those at increased risk, we also estimated the number of individuals at high risk (defined as those that would require hospital admission if infected) using age-specific infection\textendash hospitalisation ratios for COVID-19 estimated for mainland China and making adjustments to reflect country-specific differences in the prevalence of underlying conditions and frailty. We assumed males were twice at likely as females to be at high risk. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at increased risk because of their age, using minimum ages from 50 to 70 years. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 95\% confidence limits for country population size, disease prevalences, multimorbidity fractions, and infection\textendash hospitalisation ratios, and plausible low and high estimates for the degree of clustering, informed by multimorbidity studies. We estimated that 1{$\cdot$}7 billion (UI 1{$\cdot$}0\textendash 2{$\cdot$}4) people, comprising 22\% (UI 15\textendash 28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from {$<$}5\% of those younger than 20 years to {$>$}66\% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated that 349 million (186\textendash 787) people (4\% [3\textendash 9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from {$<$}1\% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20\% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated 6\% (3\textendash 12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3\% (2\textendash 7) of females. The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence. Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease. About one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age. Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.},

  abstract = {As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Black and Hispanic households have been more likely to lose income and experience difficulty making rent or mortgage payments, according to our analysis of data from the Census Bureau's new weekly Household Pulse Survey (HPS). Our analysis draws on data collected between May 21 and 26 in this weekly survey, which asked nearly 89,000 respondents about their social and economic situations since March 13, 2020, when lockdowns and restrictions began in many states. As discussed in our previous blog, despite its name, the HPS currently presents information on impacted individuals (not households), which may overstate the pandemic's household-level impacts and makes it difficult to interpret some results. To address this issue, we calculated household-weights and produced household-level estimates. Using this approach, we found that Black and Hispanic households are much more likely to have been hurt by the economic impacts of COVID-19. More than half of Hispanic (58 percent) and Black (53 percent) households experienced a decline in employment income since mid-March, much higher than the share of Asian/other ethnicity (44 percent) and white (39 percent) households. Moreover, renters were more vulnerable than homeowners: 52 percent of all renters had lost income from employment in the past two months compared to 39 percent of all homeowners (Figure 1) and Hispanic renters were hit the hardest. Almost two in every three Hispanic renters lost employment income (64 percent), followed by Black (57 percent), Asian/other (51 percent), and white (47 percent) renters. While renters were impacted the most, many homeowners also lost income. Among homeowners, Black and Hispanic homeowners were disproportionally impacted. About half of Hispanic (53 percent) and Black (49 percent) homeowners lost employment income since mid-March, compared with 40 percent of Asian/other ethnicity and 36 percent of white homeowners.},

Using Current Population Survey data matched across adjacent months from 1989\textendash 2004, this article provides the first detailed examination of labor market transitions for prime-age black and white men to test the last hired, first fired hypothesis. Considerable evidence is presented that blacks are the first fired as the business cycle weakens. However, no evidence is found that blacks are the last hired. Instead, blacks appear to be initially hired from the ranks of the unemployed early in the business cycle and later are drawn from nonparticipation. The narrowing of the racial unemployment gap near the peak of the business cycle is driven by a reduction in the rate of job loss for blacks rather than increases in hiring.},

Some, but not all, reports indicated that infection rates were also relatively high among African Americans. In early April, Mother Jones began requesting racial and ethnic breakdowns of COVID-19 infections and deaths from health departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.2 Of those, 21 states released no racial or ethnic breakdowns of those infected by mid-April. Twentysix states did not release breakdowns of fatalities by race. Despite the inadequacy of public health surveillance data, there was reason to be deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact COVID-19 was having on African Americans. The initial reports ofpronounced ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates quickly led to concerted calls from community activists, policymakers, and lawmakers for improved public health surveillance data that provide monitoring of racial disparities in rates of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths.Epidemiological data indicate that marked racial disparities exist in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, with higher rates among African Americans. Racial disparities are evident in all regions of the country (Table 1).1 7 Current data are preliminary and limited. Comprehensive surveillance data are urgently needed that include racial/ethnic characteristics and gender, underscoring that some US populations are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. At a later stage, differentials based on zip codes, as was done years ago for HIV in several locations, could further map population disparities in COVID-19 in greater detail.},

Study Objective: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. Setting: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. Participants: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. Main outcome measures: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. Results: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5\% for every 1\% increase in county AA density (p\&lt;.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). Conclusion: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.},

On March 9, there was an 800\% increase in the use of these terms in conservative news media articles. Using data from non-Asian respondents of the Project Implicit ``Asian Implicit Association Test'' from 2007\textendash 2020 (n = 339,063), we sought to ascertain if this change in media tone increased bias against Asian Americans. Local polynomial regression and interrupted time-series analyses revealed that Implicit Americanness Bias\textemdash or the subconscious belief that European American individuals are more ``American'' than Asian American individuals\textemdash declined steadily from 2007 through early 2020 but reversed trend and began to increase on March 8, following the increase in stigmatizing language in conservative media outlets. The trend reversal in bias was more pronounced among conservative individuals. This research provides evidence that the use of stigmatizing language increased subconscious beliefs that Asian Americans are ``perpetual foreigners.'' Given research that perpetual foreigner bias can beget discriminatory behavior and that experiencing discrimination is associated with adverse mental and physical health outcomes, this research sounds an alarm about the effects of stigmatizing media on the health and welfare of Asian Americans.},

It's now really the consensus that addressing social determinants of health is critical to the health and well being of vulnerable populations. And we only expect this trend to accelerate.'' Most state Medicaid programs and their Medicaid managed care organizations integrated social determinants of health strategies into their care management, with 27 states screening for social determinants, 37 states coordinating social services for beneficiaries, and 35 states referring to social services. Importantly, Medicaid programs proved aware of their interdependency with community-based organizations to fill knowledge gaps regarding the specific health needs of each community. Nearly half of all states (23 states) partnered with community-based organizations to meet beneficiary social determinants of health needs.},

  abstract = {Importance: Certain individuals, when infected by SARS-CoV-2, tend to develop the more severe forms of Covid-19 illness for reasons that remain unclear. Objective: To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. Design: Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. Setting: A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. Participants: All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N = 442). Results: Of all patients studied, 48\% required hospitalization, 17\% required intensive care, and 12\% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P{$<$}0.001), male (OR 2.0, P = 0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P = 0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P = 0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P = 0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P{$<$}0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (Pinteraction{$<$}0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P = 0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. Conclusions and relevance: In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings.},

As our global situation begins to improve and actions are taken to provide support for vulnerable and marginalized communities, we need to look at the comparative levels of improvement and assess the needs of various communities to ensure that no one is left behind. For this second study, in addition to INNOVATIVE, we also partnered with the ACCEC (African Caribbean Civic Engagement Council), a national public affairs organization that works to strengthen and promote opportunities for African Caribbean, Black and racialized communities. Through this partnership, we were able to collect the community input needed to look at the impacts of COVID-19 on marginalized, especially Black and racialized, LGBTQI2S people in Canada.

In particular, this essay examines palliative and end-of-life care for African Americans, highlighting the ways in which American medicine, like American society, has breached trust. In the experience of many African American patients struggling against terminal illness, health care providers have denied them a say in their own medical decision-making. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, African Americans have once again been denied a say with regard to the rationing of scarce medical resources such as ventilators, in that dominant and ostensibly race-neutral algorithms sacrifice black lives. Is there such thing as a ``good'' or ``dignified'' death when African Americans are dying not merely of Covid-19 but of structural racism?},

  abstract = {Massachusetts has one of the highest cumulative incidence rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US. Understanding which specific demographic, economic, and occupational factors have contributed to disparities of COVID-19 is critical to inform public health strategies. We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 Massachusetts towns/cities (01/01/2020\textendash 05/06/2020) and found that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black population was associated with a 312.3 increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while a 10 percentage point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the proportion of foreign-born non-citizens living in a community, mean household size, and share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted, and may be explained by other systemic inequities. Public health and policy efforts that improve care for foreign born non-citizens, address crowded housing, and protect food-service workers may help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among minority communities. [Editor's Note: This Fast Track Ahead Of Print article is the accepted version of the peer-reviewed manuscript. The final edited version will appear in an upcoming issue of Health Affairs.] CONCLUSION Across Massachusetts cities and towns, significant COVID-19 disparities are evident along multiple dimensions\textemdash particularly race/ethnicity, foreign-born non-citizen status, household size, and job type. Higher proportions of Black or Latino residents within a community was significantly associated with higher rates of COVID-19 cases. The factors examined in our study explained this relationship for Latino communities but did not appear to explain the higher rates among black communities. Further research into the social and economic factors underlying COVID-19-related disparities and new policies to address risk factors and institutional racism will be critical to controlling the epidemic and improving health equity.},

  abstract = {Background   There is limited data on the clinical presentation and predictors of mortality in the African-American(AA) patients hospitalized with COVID-19 despite the disproportionately higher burden and mortality. The aim of this study is to report on the clinical characteristics and the predictors of mortality in hospitalized AA patients with COVID-19 infection. Methods   In this retrospective cohort review, we included all AA patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection admitted to an inner-city teaching community hospital in New York City. Demographics, clinical presentation, baseline co-morbidities, and laboratory data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results   Of the 408 (median age, 67years) patients included, 276(66.65\%, median age 63years) survived while 132(33.35\%, median age 71years) died. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, myalgia, fever/chills, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), with a prevalence of 62.50\%, 43.87\%, 53.68\%, and 27.21\%, respectively. Age (OR 1.06, CI 1.04-1.08, P- {$<$}0.001), body mass index (OR 1.07, CI 1.04-1.11, P- {$<$}0.001), elevated serum ferritin(OR 1.99, CI 1.08-3.66, P- 0.02), C-reactive protein (OR 2.42, CI 1.36-4.33, P-0.01), and D-dimers(OR 3.79, CI 2.21-6.50, P- {$<$}0.001) at the time of presentation were identified as the independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions   Cough, shortness of breath, fever/chills, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgia were the predominant presentation among African-Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 infection. Advanced age, higher BMI, elevated serum ferritin, C-reactive protein, and D-dimers are independent predictors of mortality among hospitalized African-Americans with COVID-19 infection.},

It has often been reported that Black and brown lives have been lost in greater percentages this year to coronavirus as people of color have been disproportionately represented in case counts. In essence, the model shows the impact of inequality on a nation as a whole, when it has been easier to compartmentalize the effects of COVID-19 in communities of color, often attributed to systemic racism. ``As case numbers and hospitalizations spike across the country,'' Goff and his colleagues and creators of the model note that ``our inability to protect ourselves and each other is directly tied to our inability to reckon with injustice.''  Goff and his coauthors continue, ``Racial disparities in our essential systems amplify the risk of infection for everyone, including those who may have imagined themselves as separate from the people behind the climbing casualty figures.'' Using the best data available to them, the authors simulated a city of five million to track COVID-19's spread over 40 days. The model allowed them to calculate how many people comprising the ``three essential systems with large racial disparities'' were infected and thus infected others: ``1) police officers and the people who they come into contact with, 2) people returning home from jail and prisons (known as `churn'), and 3) frontline, low-wage workers with no option but to keep showing up.'' The model showed that its three groups ``accounted for roughly 69 percent of new infections.''},

Persistent racial disparities in health status, access to health care, wealth, employment, wages, housing, income, and poverty all contribute to greater susceptibility to the virus\textemdash both economically and physically. The authors explain there are three main groups of workers in the COVID-19 economy: those who have lost their jobs and face economic insecurity, those who are essential and face health insecurity, and those who are able to continue working from the safety of their homes. Black workers are least likely to be in that last group, with more economic and health security. As of April, less than half of the adult black population was employed. The black unemployment rate, even in the tightest of labor markets, remains significantly higher than the white unemployment rate. As of the latest data, the black unemployment rate is 16.7\%, compared with a white unemployment rate of 14.2\%. While black workers make up about one in nine workers overall, they make up about one in six of all front-line industry workers. They are disproportionately represented in employment in grocery, convenience, and drug stores, public transit, trucking, warehouse, and postal service, health care, and child care and social services. While, in the near-term, this protects them from job loss, it exposes them to greater likelihood of contracting COVID-19 while performing their jobs. Fewer than one in five black workers in the pre-pandemic economy were able to work from home.},

Profiling of Asians or mongoloid looking individuals as a suspect carrier of the virus and the resultant taunts and discriminations occur worldwide. In India, the pandemic has reinforce racism against Northeast Indians, which the country has been grappling with this social problem in the last one decade or so. Such discriminations were overt acts of racial prejudice that primarily stems from the nonrecognition or misrecognition of Northeast Indians, who are mainly mongoloid race, as Indians. During the pandemic, the fight by Northeast Indians was with the mindset of the rest of Indians as much as the virus itself. It was a fight not only against the presumption of being `non-Indian' with negative affiliation, or worse `unwanted Indians', but also to get due recognition and acceptance as equal Indians. The absence of stringent anti-racism laws may have resulted in the pervasiveness of overt acts of racism during the pandemic. However, such actions are best understood on the structural elements that underpin Indian societies. The legal measures to address this social problem will reduce overt acts of racism but addressing covert racial acts, which are structural in nature, is a long way to go.},

The two operate together, since the public health crisis has dramatically reduced economic activity and overall spending. Moreover, this crisis has broader distributional consequences than any economic event in recent memory, altering most aspects of how we live, work, and conduct business\textemdash and in truth, who will survive.  Across the economy and society, the distributional consequences of COVID-19 are uneven: the pandemic and its broader economic and health consequences are disproportionately impacting Black Americans.  The outsized challenges that Black Americans are facing are a reflection of the generally diminished economic position and health status that they faced prior to this crisis. Several pre\textendash{} COVID-19 economic conditions\textemdash including lower levels of income and wealth, higher unemployment, and greater levels of food and housing insecurity\textemdash leave Black families with fewer buffers to absorb economic shocks and contribute to Black households' vulnerability to the COVID-19 economic crisis. The interaction of those pre\textendash COVID-19 economic and health disparities\textemdash including a higher rate of preexisting health conditions such as hypertension and lung disease\textemdash{} as contributed to higher COVID-19 mortality rates for Black Americans (e.g. Benitez, Courtemanche, and Yelowitz 2020; Weimers et al. 2020). According to the APM Research Lab, Black Americans continue to experience the highest overall actual COVID-19 mortality rates (80.4 per 100,000)\textemdash more than twice the rate of white Americans (35.9 per 100,000) or Asian Americans (33.1 per 100,000), who have the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates. In 2020 more Black Americans will die of COVID-19 than will succumb to diabetes, strokes, accidents, or pneumonia. In fact, COVID-19 is currently the third leading cause of death for Black Americans (APM Research Lab 2020).},

Vera's analysis of the most comprehensive jail data available shows that the number of people in jail in the United States fell by one quarter, mainly over the course of that month. Jail bookings dropped as people who would otherwise have been arrested stayed home, and police and sheriffs made fewer arrests. Simultaneously, many judges and prosecutors used their broad discretion to facilitate the release of people they deemed ``safe,'' while public defenders filed thousands of motions to secure the release of their clients. But as the United States faces continued outbreaks of COVID-19, it is crucial to recognize that decarceration has still been inadequate, from both a public safety and a public health perspective.},

However, early methods to procure and develop treatments and vaccines by some high-income countries reflect ongoing protectionist and nationalistic attitudes that can systemically exclude access for people in regions with weaker health systems.

While racial disparities in cumulative incidence (CmI) and mortality from the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 implicated Blacks with survival disadvantage relative to Whites in the United States, COVID-19 currently indicates comparable disparities. We aimed to: (a) assess COVID-19 CmI by race, (b) determine the Black\&ndash;White case fatality (CF) and risk differentials, and (c) apply explanatory model for mortality risk differentials. Methods: COVID-19 data on confirmed cases and deaths by selective states health departments were assessed using a cross-sectional ecologic design. Chi-square was used for CF independence, while binomial regression model for the Black\&ndash;White risk differentials. Results: The COVID-19 mortality CmI indicated Blacks/AA with 34\% of the total mortality in the United States, albeit their 13\% population size. The COVID-19 CF was higher among Blacks/AA relative to Whites; Maryland, (2.7\% vs. 2.5\%), Wisconsin (7.4\% vs. 4.8\%), Illinois (4.8\% vs. 4.2\%), Chicago (5.9\% vs. 3.2\%), Detroit (Michigan), 7.2\% and St. John the Baptist Parish (Louisiana), 7.9\%. Blacks/AA compared to Whites in Michigan were 15\% more likely to die, CmI risk ratio (CmIRR) = 1.15, 95\% CI, 1.01\&ndash;1.32. Blacks/AA relative to Whites in Illinois were 13\% more likely to die, CmIRR = 1.13, 95\% CI, 0.93\&ndash;1.39, while Blacks/AA compared to Whites in Wisconsin were 51\% more likely to die, CmIRR = 1.51, 95\% CI, 1.10\&ndash;2.10. In Chicago, Blacks/AA were more than twice as likely to die, CmIRR = 2.24, 95\% CI, 1.36\&ndash;3.88. Conclusion: Substantial racial/ethnic disparities are observed in COVID-19 CF and mortality with Blacks/AA disproportionately affected across the United States.},

This study aims to estimate the relative contributions to fatality disparities in terms of differences in SARS-CoV-2 infections, diagnoses, and disease severity. Methods We constructed COVID-19 outcome continua (similar to the HIV care continuum) for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults in New York State. For each stage in the COVID-19 outcome continua (population, infection experience, diagnosis, hospitalization, fatality), we synthesized the most recent publicly available data. We described each continuum using overall percentages, fatality rates, and relative changes between stages, with comparisons between race and ethnicity using risk ratios. Results Estimated per-population COVID-19 fatality rates were 0.03\%, 0.18\%, and 0.12\% for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults, respectively. The 3.48-fold disparity for Hispanic, relative to white, communities was explained by differences in infection experience, whereas the 5.38-fold disparity for non-Hispanic Black, relative to white, communities was primarily driven by differences in both infection experience and in the need for hospitalization, given infection. Conclusions These findings suggest the most impactful stages on which to intervene with programs and policies to build COVID-19 health equity.},

The second report states clearly that factors such as racism, discrimination, and social inequality may have contributed to the increased risk of death from covid-19 among ethnic minority groups.

  abstract = {Introduction Because of their inability to access adequate medical care, transportation, and nutrition, socially vulnerable populations are at an increased risk of health challenges during disasters. This study estimates the association between case counts of COVID-19 infection and social vulnerability in the U.S., identifying counties at increased vulnerability to the pandemic. Methods Using Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 case count data, an ordinary least squares regression model was fitted to assess the global relationship between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability. Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial nonstationarity. Results As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5\%, 2,844 of 3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the global level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (e{$\beta$}=1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (e{$\beta$}=6.69, p{$<$}0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, on the basis of the local geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection. Conclusions Large-scale disasters differentially affect the health of marginalized communities. In this study, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. Addressing the social factors that create poor health is essential to reducing inequities in the health impacts of disasters.},

To understand the emerging pattern of racial inequality in the effects of COVID-19, we examined the relative burden of social vulnerability and health risk factors. We found significant spatial clusters of social vulnerability and risk factors, both of which are significantly associated with the increased COVID-19-related death rate. We also found that a higher percentage of African Americans was associated with increased levels of social vulnerability and risk factors. In addition, the proportion of African American residents has an independent effect on the COVID-19 death rate. We argue that existing inequity is often highlighted in emergency conditions. The disproportionate effects of COVID-19 in African American communities are a reflection of racial inequality and social exclusion that existed before the COVID-19 crisis.},

  abstract = {We correlate county-level COVID-19 death rates with key variables using both linear regression and negative binomial mixed models, although we focus on linear regression models. We include four sets of variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes of commuting, and climate and pollution patterns. Our analysis studies daily death rates from April 4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We estimate correlation patterns both across states, as well as within states. For both models, we find higher shares of African American residents in the county are correlated with higher death rates. However, when we restrict ourselves to correlation patterns within a given state, the statistical significance of the correlation of death rates with the share of African Americans, while remaining positive, wanes. We find similar results for the share of elderly in the county. We find that higher amounts of commuting via public transportation, relative to telecommuting, is correlated with higher death rates. The correlation between driving into work, relative to telecommuting, and death rates is also positive across both models, but statistically significant only when we look across states and counties. We also find that a higher share of people not working, and thus not commuting either because they are elderly, children or unemployed, is correlated with higher death rates. Counties with higher home values, higher summer temperatures, and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates. Contrary to past work, we do not find a correlation between pollution and death rates. Also importantly, we do not find that death rates are correlated with obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates. Finally, our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given state's death rate compares to other states after controlling for the variables included in our model; this may be interpreted as a measure of how states are doing relative to others. We find that death rates in the Northeast are substantially higher compared to other states, even when we control for the four sets of variables above. Death rates are also statistically significantly higher in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. California's death rate is the lowest across all states.},

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of vulnerable populations, such as those with gynecologic cancer who develop COVID-19 infections, is limited. Methods   Patients from 6 NYC-area hospital systems with known gynecologic cancer and a COVID-19 diagnosis were identified. Demographic and clinical outcome data were abstracted through a review of electronic medical records. Results   Records for 121 patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID-19 were abstracted; the median age at the COVID-19 diagnosis was 64.0 years (interquartile range, 51.0-73.0 years). Sixty-six of the 121 patients (54.5\%) required hospitalization; among the hospitalized patients, 45 (68.2\%) required respiratory intervention, 20 (30.3\%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 9 (13.6\%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen patients (14.0\%) died of COVID-19 complications. No patient requiring mechanical ventilation survived. On multivariable analysis, hospitalization was associated with an age {$\geq$}64 years (risk ratio [RR], 1.73; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.18-2.51), African American race (RR, 1.56; 95\% CI, 1.13-2.15), and 3 or more comorbidities (RR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.98). Only recent immunotherapy use (RR, 3.49; 95\% CI, 1.08-11.27) was associated with death due to COVID-19 on multivariable analysis; chemotherapy treatment and recent major surgery were not predictive of COVID-19 severity or mortality. Conclusions   The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a COVID-19 infection is 14.0\%. Recent immunotherapy use is associated with an increased risk of mortality related to COVID-19 infection. Lay Summary   The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection is 14.0\%; there is no association between cytotoxic chemotherapy and cancer-directed surgery and COVID-19 severity or death. As such, patients can be counseled regarding the safety of continued anticancer treatments during the pandemic. This is important because the ability to continue cancer therapies for cancer control and cure is critical.},

  abstract = {Background Differentials in COVID-19 hospitalisations and mortality according to ethnicity have been reported but their origin is uncertain. We examined the role of socioeconomic, mental health, and pro-inflammatory factors in a community-based sample. Methods We used data on 340,966 men and women (mean age 56.2~years) from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort study with linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between ethnicity and hospitalisation for COVID-19. Results There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571/324,306 White, 31/4,485 Black, 21/5,732 Asian, 17/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio; 95\% confidence interval: 4.32; 3.00\textendash 6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the `other' non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for potential explanatory factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, household crowding, smoking, body size, inflammation, glycated haemoglobin, and mental illness, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33\% for Blacks, 52\% for Asians and 43\% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31). Conclusions There were clear ethnic differences in risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and these do not appear to be fully explained by measured factors.

  abstract = {The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19) has been spreading at an exponential rate around the world since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.1 As of April 4, 2020, more than 1 000 000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in more than 150 countries, resulting in more than 50 000 deaths. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and US president Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13.There is no question that it is important for China and other countries to work together to stop the spread of COVID-19, and there is much to commend about the international response to the virus. That effort has to, definitionally, involve a focus on disease containment in China and in travel to and from China. However, one ofthe unintended emerging consequences of the global response to this pandemic has been increasing reports around the world of racism and xenophobia against Asian people, particularly people of Chinese descent. On social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, anti-Chinese sentiment has been growing since the virus outbreak, perpetuating the stereotype that Chinese people are unclean and disease ridden. Some news articles in the United States, Australia, and France have used racist terms such as "China virus" and "yellow alert." There were multiple incidents of hatred and violence against people of Asian descent because of COVID-19 around the world (see the Appendix, available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://www.ajph. org). As SARS-CoV-2 infects more and more people worldwide, episodes of racism against people of Asian descent may continue to grow, potentially exacerbated by fear and disinformation about the virus.Racism is an important determinant of health. Growing research shows that racism and racial discrimination have adverse effects on both the mental and physical health of those targeted by it. However, most studies on racism in the United States have focused on African Americans, and few studies have assessed the impact of racism on population health among other racial/ethnic groups such as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. There is no reason to suspect that racism does not have similar adverse health effects across different population groups; thus, racism directed at people of Asian descent during this outbreak should be a cause for alarm.},

Limited racial data is available on a national level.; Methods: We conducted the first nationwide analysis to examine COVID-19 and race on a county level. We obtained datasets on COVID-19 cases and deaths, and racial population totals, by US county. We examined if correlations exist between the racial percentages and percentages of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by county.; Results: A positive correlation existed between percentages of African-Americans living in a county and who have COVID-19 (r~=~0.254, P~{$<~$}0.0001), who have died from COVID-19 (r~=~0.268, P~{$<~$}0.0001), and case mortality (r~=~0.055, P~=~0.003). Positive correlations also existed between percentages of Asian-Americans living in counties and these factors. Negative correlations existed between percentages of Whites living in counties and these factors.; Conclusions: A weak, albeit very significant, positive relationship exists between the percentage of African-Americans living in a county and the percentage of COVID-19 confirmed cases, confirmed deaths and case mortality in the county. This is in support of many city and statewide analyses, and we urge for targeted resources towards work that further examine these racial associations. (\textcopyright{} The Author(s) 2020.

  abstract = {Introduction The U.S. Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE) Initiative was launched nationally in February 2019. With a target of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030, EHE initially scales up effective HIV prevention and care in 57 localities that comprise the greatest proportion of annual HIV diagnoses in the United States (US). However, the EHE effort has been eclipsed by another infectious disease eleven months into the Initiative's implementation. SARS-COV-2, a novel coronavirus, has infected more than eight million Americans and at least 223,000 (as of October 23, 2020) have succumbed to the disease. This commentary explores the social conditions that place communities of color at greater risk for COVID-19 and HIV, and assesses challenges to EHE in a post COVID-19 universe. One of the many common threads between HIV and COVID-19 is the disproportionate impact of each disease among communities of color. A recent report by the National Academy of Sciences surmised that as much as 70\% of health outcomes are due to health access, socioeconomic factors and environmental conditions. Social determinants of health associated with greater HIV burden in Black and Brown communities have re-emerged in epidemiological studies of disproportionate COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations and deaths in communities of color. Using data from the scientific literature, this commentary makes direct comparisons between HIV and COVID-19 racial disparities across the social determinants of health. Further, I examine three sets of challenges facing EHE: 1. Challenges that hamper both the EHE and COVID-19 response (i.e. insufficiently addressing the social determinants of health; amplification of disparities as new health technologies are introduced) 2. Challenges posed by COVID-19 (i.e. diverting HIV resources to address COVID-19 and tapering of EHE funding generally); and 3. Challenges unrelated to COVID-19 (i.e. emergence of new and related health disparities; repeal of the Affordable Care Act and long-term viability of EHE). Racism and discrimination place communities of color at greater risk for COVID-19 as well as HIV. Achieving and sustaining an end to the U.S. HIV epidemic will require structural change to eliminate conditions that give rise to and maintain disparities.},

Following a review of Kingdon's model of the policy-making process, we illustrate how a partnership in a large California county navigated the streams in the policy-making process and used the window of opportunity provided by the pandemic to address a major public health problem: the incarceration of over 2 million people, disproportionately African American and Latinx, in overcrowded, unsafe jails, prisons, and detention centers. We highlight tactics and strategies used, challenges faced, and implications for health educators as policy advocates during and beyond the pandemic.},

Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1\%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.},

Especially, we propose a stage-based approach to capture how the negative sentiment changes along with the three development stages of COVID-19, under which it transformed from a domestic epidemic into an international public health emergency and later, into the global pandemic. At each stage, sentiment analysis enables us to recognize the negative sentiment from tweets with racist hashtags, and keyword extraction allows for the discovery of themes in the expression of negative sentiment by these tweets. Under this public health crisis of human beings, this stage-based approach enables us to provide policy suggestions for the enactment of stage-specific intervention strategies to combat racism and xenophobia on social media in a more effective way.},

We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in this special population. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in an underserved area with a predominance of African American patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample population. The onset of AKI and relation to clinical outcomes were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with AKI. Results: Nearly half (49.3\%) of the patients with COVID-19 had AKI. Patients with AKI had a significantly lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher FiO2 requirement and D-dimer levels on admission. More subnephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria was seen in these patients, and the majority had a pre-renal urine electrolyte profile. Patients with hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) as opposed to those with community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) had higher rates of in-hospital death (52 vs. 23\%, p = 0.005), need for vasopressors (42 vs. 25\%, p = 0.024), and need for intubation (55 vs. 25\%, p = 0.006). A history of heart failure was significantly associated with AKI after adjusting for baseline eGFR (OR 3.382, 95\% CI 1.121\textendash 13.231, p = 0.032). Conclusion: We report a high burden of AKI among underserved COVID-19 patients with multiple comorbidities. Those who had HA-AKI had worse clinical outcomes compared to those who with CA-AKI. A history of heart failure is an independent predictor of AKI in patients with COVID-19.},

The invisibility of `the enemy' has in fact been rendered visible through what she refers to as contingent racism; this includes the ubiquitous and hence powerful use of irony and satire at the expense of China and Italy, but also expands to the use of banal and convenient tropes of accusation and derision among European Union member states, bringing back to the fore the North-South divide and its power imbalances. The author suggests that the Covid-19 crisis has ultimately provoked a veritable epidemic of contingent racism on multiple levels by stirring stereotypes and cultural prejudices which are rooted in time and rapidly renewed; its effect is all but contingent, and likely to accompany us far beyond the Covid-19 crisis itself.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Many reports on coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have highlighted age- and sex-related differences in health outcomes. More information is needed about racial and ethnic differences in outcomes from Covid-19. METHODS In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from patients seen within an integrated-delivery health system (Ochsner Health) in Louisiana between March 1 and April 11, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The Ochsner Health population is 31\% black non-Hispanic and 65\% white non-Hispanic. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital death. RESULTS A total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, and 52 were Asian or of another race or ethnic group). Of the 3481 Covid-19\textendash positive patients included in our analyses, 60.0\% were female, 70.4\% were black non-Hispanic, and 29.6\% were white non-Hispanic. Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients. A total of 39.7\% of Covid-19\textendash positive patients (1382 patients) were hospitalized, 76.9\% of whom were black. In multivariable analyses, black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (indicating a greater burden of illness), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission. Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6\% were black. In adjusted time-to-event analyses, variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts. However, black race was not independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio for death vs. white race, 0.89; 95\% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17). CONCLUSIONS In a large cohort in Louisiana, 76.9\% of the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 70.6\% of those who died were black, whereas blacks comprise only 31\% of the Ochsner Health population. Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission.},

Multivariate logistic regression models including age, sex and ethnicity were used to test whether addition of (1) cardiometabolic factors [diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, smoking and body mass index (BMI)]; (2) 25(OH)-vitamin D; (3) poor diet; (4) Townsend deprivation score; (5) housing (home type, overcrowding) or (6) behavioural factors (sociability, risk taking) attenuated sex/ethnicity associations with COVID-19 status.; Results: There was over-representation of men and BAME ethnicities in the COVID-19 positive group. BAME individuals had, on average, poorer cardiometabolic profile, lower 25(OH)-vitamin D, greater material deprivation, and were more likely to live in larger households and in flats/apartments. Male sex, BAME ethnicity, higher BMI, higher Townsend deprivation score and household overcrowding were independently associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19. The pattern of association was consistent for men and women; cardiometabolic, socio-demographic and behavioural factors did not attenuate sex/ethnicity associations.; Conclusions: In this study, sex and ethnicity differential pattern of COVID-19 was not adequately explained by variations in cardiometabolic factors, 25(OH)-vitamin D levels or socio-economic factors. Factors which underlie ethnic differences in COVID-19 may not be easily captured, and so investigation of alternative biological and genetic susceptibilities as well as more comprehensive assessment of the complex economic, social and behavioural differences should be prioritised.

  abstract = {A study conducted by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found a higher prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors  throughout neighborhoods that were historically ``redlined.'' Redlining, the process of withholding lending and investment from low-income and minority communities in particular neighborhoods, dating from at least the 1930s, correlates today with reduced health, greater poverty, lower life expectancy, and higher incidence of chronic disease. These, the latter two especially, are risk factors for poor outcomes for COVID-19. Historical redlining is related to present-day neighborhood characteristics including minority presence, higher occurrences of poverty, and greater social vulnerability (meaning people ``have a decreased capability to withstand natural and human-created disasters because of their more limited resources''). There are statistically significant associations between greater redlining and pre-existing conditions like asthma, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, kidney disease, obesity and stroke, all of which lead to a heightened risk of morbidity in COVID-19 patients. The report aims to understand how historical processes have created and maintained social, economic and environmental conditions that give rise to poor health. The study aims to place the historical in the present, the authors writing, ``The United States developed a deeply segregated society, the results of which are evident in the separation of communities we see today. Urban areas are often starkly divided by income and race. These divisions circumscribe the choices available to individuals.'' The divisions are also great determinants when it comes to the negative impact of COVID-19.},

We report a case series of five PLWH with COVID-19. We identified all patients with a diagnosis of HIV who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 at University of Chicago Medicine between March 1, 2020, and April 7, 2020. We retrospectively collected data regarding demographics, comorbidities, medications, laboratory test results, radiology results, and outcomes associated with COVID-19. All five PLWH with COVID-19 were African American; 80\% (4/5) were cisgender females. The mean age of patients was 48 years old (range 38\textendash 53). The majority of patients presented with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. Three patients had diarrhea. One patient presented with predominantly cardiac symptoms. All were taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CD4 count {$>$}200 cells/mm3 and suppressed HIV viral loads at the time of COVID-19 diagnosis. All five patients were hospitalized, two required supplemental oxygen, and none required mechanical ventilation. Four patients were treated with azithromycin and a cephalosporin and two were also treated with hydroxychloroquine. The median length of stay was 3 days (range 2\textendash 7). All patients recovered. More research is needed to understand the risks of COVID-19 among PLWH and the impact of ART on outcomes for patients with COVID-19.},

To better understand these factors, we investigated racial disparities in COVID-19 mortality among America's essential workers. Data from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey was used to examine the correlation between the prevalence of COVID-19 deaths and occupational differences across racial/ethnic groups and states. COVID-19 mortality was higher among non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks compared with NH Whites, due to more NH Blacks holding essential-worker positions. Vulnerability to coronavirus exposure was increased among NH Blacks, who disproportionately occupied the top nine essential occupations. As COVID-19 death rates continue to rise, existing structural inequalities continue to shape racial disparities in this pandemic. Policies mandating the disaggregation of state-level data by race/ethnicity are vital to ensure equitable and evidence-based response and recovery efforts.},

  abstract = {Background  By mid-May 2020, there were over 1.5 million cases of (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 across the U.S. with new confirmed cases continuing to rise following the re-opening of most states. Prior studies have focused mainly on clinical risk factors associated with serious illness and mortality of COVID-19. Less analysis has been conducted on the clinical, sociodemographic, and environmental variables associated with initial infection of COVID-19. Methods A multivariable statistical model was used to characterize risk factors in 34,503cases of laboratory-confirmed positive or negative COVID-19 infection in the Providence Health System (U.S.) between February 28 and April 27, 2020. Publicly available data were utilized as approximations for social determinants of health, and patient-level clinical and sociodemographic factors were extracted from the electronic medical record. Results Higher risk of COVID-19 infection was associated with older age (OR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.41\textendash 2.02, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), male gender (OR 1.32; 95\% CI 1.21\textendash 1.44, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), Asian race (OR 1.43; 95\% CI 1.18\textendash 1.72, p\,=\,0.0002), Black/African American race (OR 1.51; 95\% CI 1.25\textendash 1.83, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), Latino ethnicity (OR 2.07; 95\% CI 1.77\textendash 2.41, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), non-English language (OR 2.09; 95\% CI 1.7\textendash 2.57, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001), residing in a neighborhood with financial insecurity (OR 1.10; 95\% CI 1.01\textendash 1.25, p\,=\,0.04), low air quality (OR 1.01; 95\% CI 1.0\textendash 1.04, p\,=\,0.05), housing insecurity (OR 1.32; 95\% CI 1.16\textendash 1.5, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001) or transportation insecurity (OR 1.11; 95\% CI 1.02\textendash 1.23, p\,=\,0.03), and living in senior living communities (OR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.23\textendash 2.32, p\,=\,0.001). Conclusion sisk of COVID-19 infection is higher among groups already affected by health disparities across age, race, ethnicity, language, income, and living conditions. Health promotion and disease prevention strategies should prioritize groups most vulnerable to infection and address structural inequities that contribute to risk through social and economic policy.},

In particular, the test distribution across income levels is significantly more egalitarian than the distribution of income itself: The ten percent of the city's population living in the richest zip codes received 11 percent of the Covid-19 tests and 29 percent of the city's income. The ten percent of the city's population living in the poorest zip codes received 10 percent of the tests but only 4 percent of the city's income.

Thus, when all factors were considered, whites tended to be at higher overall risk compared to blacks, with Asians and Hispanics having much lower overall levels of risk compared to either whites or blacks. We explored additional explanations for COVID-19 disparities, namely differences in job characteristics and how they interact with household composition. Blacks at high risk of severe illness were 1.6 times as likely as whites to live in households containing health-sector workers. Among Hispanic adults at high risk of severe illness, 64.5~percent lived in households with at least one worker who was unable to work at home, versus 56.5~percent among blacks and only 46.6~percent among whites.

Food That Connects Us All is a program that provides healthy meals to low-income Black and Hispanic families in Baltimore City. The meals follow guidelines for the planetary health diet, a reference diet developed by the EAT-Lancet Commission to optimize health and be sustainable within planetary boundaries. The planetary health diet consists largely of vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and unsaturated oils, with a low to moderate amount of seafood and poultry and with little or no red or processed meats, refined grains, starchy vegetables, and added sugar. In a food survey, participants showed a high level of satisfaction with the taste, appearance, and healthfulness of the meals.

We hypothesized that, among adolescents, the association between air pollution and cardiometabolic function is exacerbated among residents of economically marginalized areas. Methods In this cross-sectional study, individual-level data on cardiometabolic function collected from a representative sample of U.S. adolescents in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n~=~10,415) were merged with data on area-level poverty (U.S. decennial survey and American Community Survey) and air pollution levels (National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment~) using contemporary census-tract identifiers. We excluded respondents who were pregnant, had hypertension or diabetes or using medication for hypertension or diabetes, or with missing data on outcome variables. Results We observed a significant interaction between area-level poverty and air pollution. Among residents of high-poverty areas, exposure to high levels of air pollution predicted a 30\% elevated odds of cardiometabolic dysfunction (OR~=~1.30; 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.61), whereas in low-poverty areas, exposure to high levels of air pollution was not associated with elevated odds of cardiometabolic dysfunction (OR~=~1.04; 95\% CI: 0.85, 1.28). Conclusions Our findings suggest that the cardiometabolic consequences of air pollution are more readily realized among residents of economically marginalized areas.

The panel referenced explicetly that people of color - spefically Black, Latinx, American Indian, and Alaska Native - have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 with "higher rates of transmission, morbidity, and mortality," and placed the cause of this on systemic racism and not inherent biological traits. Rather than focus on discrete racial and ethnic categories, the committe attempted to address this systemic racism by focussing on socioeconmic factors such as "having front line jobs, crowded living conditions, lack of access to personal protective equipment, and the inability to work from home."},

Binary logistic regression is used to model the main effects of, and interactions between, race, gender, education, household income and sexual orientation on hypertension, controlling for age, using data from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey (n~=~90,310). From a main effects (`additive') perspective, Black respondents, respondents with less than high school and poorer respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents, university-educated Canadians and wealthier Canadians, respectively, to report hypertension. However, the interactive models indicate that the additive models were poor predictors of hypertension for wealthy Black men, wealthy South Asian women, women with less than a high school diploma and wealthy bisexual respondents, who were more likely than expected to report hypertension, and for poor Black men, poor South Asian women, poor South Asian men and women with a university degree, who were less likely than expected to report hypertension. It appears that, with regard to blood pressure at least, Canadians experience the health effects of education differently by their genders and the health effects of income differently by their identities defined at the intersection of race and gender. This study provides empirical support for the intersectional approach to cardiovascular health inequalities by demonstrating that race, gender, class and sexuality cannot be disentangled from one another as predictors of hypertension.},

The bleak statistics have helped convince more than 20 cities and counties and at least three states-Michigan, Ohio, and Wisconsin-to declare racism a public health crisis. Supporters say the designations are meant to spur changes across all sectors of government-including criminal justice, education, health care, housing, transportation, budgets and taxes, economic development, and social services-with the goal of shrinking the health gap between Black and white Americans.

This lack of access to and the quality of healthcare, affordable housing, and lack of financial resources also continue to have a more significant impact on documented and undocumented immigrants. This paper aims at examining these critical issues and developing a framework for family therapists to address these challenges by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: cultural values, social determinants of health, collective trauma, and the ethical and moral responsibility of family therapists. Given the fact that family therapists may unwittingly function as the best ally of an economic and political system that perpetuates institutionalized racism and class discrimination, we need to utilize a set of principles, values, and practices that are not just palliative or after the fact but bring forth into the psychotherapeutic and policy work a politics of care. Therefore, a strong call to promote and advocate for the broader continuum of health and critical thinking preparing professionals to meet the challenges of health equity, as well as economic and environmental justice, are needed. The issues discussed in this paper are specific to the United States despite their relevance to family therapy as a field. We are mindful not to generalize the United States' reality to the rest of the world, recognizing that issues discussed in this paper could potentially contribute to international discourse.
