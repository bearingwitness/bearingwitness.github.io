	abstract = {BACKGROUND
Many reports on coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) have highlighted age- and sex-related differences in health outcomes. More information is needed about racial and ethnic differences in outcomes from Covid-19.

METHODS
In this retrospective cohort study, we analyzed data from patients seen within an integrated-delivery health system (Ochsner Health) in Louisiana between March 1 and April 11, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19) on qualitative polymerase-chain-reaction assay. The Ochsner Health population is 31\% black non-Hispanic and 65\% white non-Hispanic. The primary outcomes were hospitalization and in-hospital death.

RESULTS
A total of 3626 patients tested positive, of whom 145 were excluded (84 had missing data on race or ethnic group, 9 were Hispanic, and 52 were Asian or of another race or ethnic group). Of the 3481 Covid-19–positive patients included in our analyses, 60.0\% were female, 70.4\% were black non-Hispanic, and 29.6\% were white non-Hispanic. Black patients had higher prevalences of obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease than white patients. A total of 39.7\% of Covid-19–positive patients (1382 patients) were hospitalized, 76.9\% of whom were black. In multivariable analyses, black race, increasing age, a higher score on the Charlson Comorbidity Index (indicating a greater burden of illness), public insurance (Medicare or Medicaid), residence in a low-income area, and obesity were associated with increased odds of hospital admission. Among the 326 patients who died from Covid-19, 70.6\% were black. In adjusted time-to-event analyses, variables that were associated with higher in-hospital mortality were increasing age and presentation with an elevated respiratory rate; elevated levels of venous lactate, creatinine, or procalcitonin; or low platelet or lymphocyte counts. However, black race was not independently associated with higher mortality (hazard ratio for death vs. white race, 0.89; 95\% confidence interval, 0.68 to 1.17).

CONCLUSIONS
In a large cohort in Louisiana, 76.9\% of the patients who were hospitalized with Covid-19 and 70.6\% of those who died were black, whereas blacks comprise only 31\% of the Ochsner Health population. Black race was not associated with higher in-hospital mortality than white race, after adjustment for differences in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics on admission.},

	abstract = {The novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), declared a pandemic in March 2020, may present with disproportionately higher rates in underrepresented racial/ethnic minority populations in the United States, including African American communities who have traditionally been over-represented in negative health outcomes. Study Objective: To understand the impact of the density of African American communities (defined as the percentage of African Americans in a county) on COVID-19 prevalence and death rate within the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory (n=152). Design: An ecological study using linear regression was employed for the study. Setting: The top three most populous counties of each U.S. state and territory were included in analyses for a final sample size of n=152 counties. Participants: Confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths that were accumulated between January 22, 2020 and April 12, 2020 in each of the three most populous counties in each U.S. state and territory were included. Main outcome measures: Linear regression was used to determine the association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence (defined as the percentage of cases for the county population), and death rate (defined as number of deaths per 100,000 population). The models were adjusted for median age and poverty. Results: There was a direct association between African American density and COVID-19 prevalence; COVID-19 prevalence increased 5\% for every 1\% increase in county AA density (p\&lt;.01). There was also an association between county AA density and COVID-19 deaths, such; the death rate increased 2 per 100,000 for every percentage increase in county AA density (p=.02). Conclusion: These study findings indicate that communities with a high African American density have been disproportionately burdened with COVID-19. Further study is needed to indicate if this burden is related to environmental factors or individual factors such as types of employment or comorbidities that members of these community have.},

	abstract = {Informed by intersectionality theory, a tradition that theorizes intersecting power relations of racism, patriarchy, classism and heterosexism, this paper investigates the degree to which race, gender, class and sexuality manifest distinct and interconnected associations with self-reported hypertension in nationally-representative survey data from Canada. Binary logistic regression is used to model the main effects of, and interactions between, race, gender, education, household income and sexual orientation on hypertension, controlling for age, using data from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey (n = 90,310). From a main effects (‘additive’) perspective, Black respondents, respondents with less than high school and poorer respondents were significantly more likely than White respondents, university-educated Canadians and wealthier Canadians, respectively, to report hypertension. However, the interactive models indicate that the additive models were poor predictors of hypertension for wealthy Black men, wealthy South Asian women, women with less than a high school diploma and wealthy bisexual respondents, who were more likely than expected to report hypertension, and for poor Black men, poor South Asian women, poor South Asian men and women with a university degree, who were less likely than expected to report hypertension. It appears that, with regard to blood pressure at least, Canadians experience the health effects of education differently by their genders and the health effects of income differently by their identities defined at the intersection of race and gender. This study provides empirical support for the intersectional approach to cardiovascular health inequalities by demonstrating that race, gender, class and sexuality cannot be disentangled from one another as predictors of hypertension.},

	title = {Black workers face two of the most lethal preexisting conditions for coronavirus—racism and economic inequality},
	url = {https://www.epi.org/publication/black-workers-covid/},
	abstract = {A new report by director of EPI’s Program on Race, Ethnicity, and the Economy Valerie Wilson and senior economist Elise Gould explores how racial and economic inequality have left many black workers with few good options for protecting both their health and economic well-being during the coronavirus pandemic. Persistent racial disparities in health status, access to health care, wealth, employment, wages, housing, income, and poverty all contribute to greater susceptibility to the virus—both economically and physically.

The authors explain there are three main groups of workers in the COVID-19 economy: those who have lost their jobs and face economic insecurity, those who are essential and face health insecurity, and those who are able to continue working from the safety of their homes. Black workers are least likely to be in that last group, with more economic and health security.

As of April, less than half of the adult black population was employed. The black unemployment rate, even in the tightest of labor markets, remains significantly higher than the white unemployment rate. As of the latest data, the black unemployment rate is 16.7\%, compared with a white unemployment rate of 14.2\%.

While black workers make up about one in nine workers overall, they make up about one in six of all front-line industry workers. They are disproportionately represented in employment in grocery, convenience, and drug stores, public transit, trucking, warehouse, and postal service, health care, and child care and social services. While, in the near-term, this protects them from job loss, it exposes them to greater likelihood of contracting COVID-19 while performing their jobs. Fewer than one in five black workers in the pre-pandemic economy were able to work from home.},

	abstract = {We correlate county-level COVID-19 death rates with key variables using both linear regression and negative binomial mixed models, although we focus on linear regression models. We include four sets of variables: socio-economic variables, county-level health variables, modes of commuting, and climate and pollution patterns. Our analysis studies daily death rates from April 4, 2020 to May 27, 2020. We estimate correlation patterns both across states, as well as within states. For both models, we ﬁnd higher shares of African American residents in the county are correlated with higher death rates. However, when we restrict ourselves to correlation patterns within a given state, the statistical signiﬁcance of the correlation of death rates with the share of African Americans, while remaining positive, wanes. We ﬁnd similar results for the share of elderly in the county. We ﬁnd that higher amounts of commuting via public transportation, relative to telecommuting, is correlated with higher death rates. The correlation between driving into work, relative to telecommuting, and death rates is also positive across both models, but statistically signiﬁcant only when we look across states and counties. We also ﬁnd that a higher share of people not working, and thus not commuting either because they are elderly, children or unemployed, is correlated with higher death rates. Counties with higher home values, higher summer temperatures, and lower winter temperatures have higher death rates. Contrary to past work, we do not ﬁnd a correlation between pollution and death rates. Also importantly, we do not ﬁnd that death rates are correlated with obesity rates, ICU beds per capita, or poverty rates. Finally, our model that looks within states yields estimates of how a given state’s death rate compares to other states after controlling for the variables included in our model; this may be interpreted as a measure of how states are doing relative to others. We ﬁnd that death rates in the Northeast are substantially higher compared to other states, even when we control for the four sets of variables above. Death rates are also statistically signiﬁcantly higher in Michigan, Louisiana, Iowa, Indiana, and Colorado. California’s death rate is the lowest across all states.},

	abstract = {The risk of severe COVID-19 if an individual becomes infected is known to be higher in older individuals and those with underlying health conditions. Understanding the number of individuals at increased risk of severe COVID-19 and how this varies between countries should inform the design of possible strategies to shield or vaccinate those at highest risk. We estimated the number of individuals at increased risk of severe disease (defined as those with at least one condition listed as "at increased risk of severe COVID-19" in current guidelines) by age (5-year age groups), sex, and country for 188 countries using prevalence data from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2017 and UN population estimates for 2020. The list of underlying conditions relevant to COVID-19 was determined by mapping the conditions listed in GBD 2017 to those listed in guidelines published by WHO and public health agencies in the UK and the USA. We analysed data from two large multimorbidity studies to determine appropriate adjustment factors for clustering and multimorbidity. To help interpretation of the degree of risk among those at increased risk, we also estimated the number of individuals at high risk (defined as those that would require hospital admission if infected) using age-specific infection–hospitalisation ratios for COVID-19 estimated for mainland China and making adjustments to reflect country-specific differences in the prevalence of underlying conditions and frailty. We assumed males were twice at likely as females to be at high risk. We also calculated the number of individuals without an underlying condition that could be considered at increased risk because of their age, using minimum ages from 50 to 70 years. We generated uncertainty intervals (UIs) for our estimates by running low and high scenarios using the lower and upper 95\% confidence limits for country population size, disease prevalences, multimorbidity fractions, and infection–hospitalisation ratios, and plausible low and high estimates for the degree of clustering, informed by multimorbidity studies. We estimated that 1·7 billion (UI 1·0–2·4) people, comprising 22\% (UI 15–28) of the global population, have at least one underlying condition that puts them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 if infected (ranging from {\textless}5\% of those younger than 20 years to {\textgreater}66\% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated that 349 million (186–787) people (4\% [3–9] of the global population) are at high risk of severe COVID-19 and would require hospital admission if infected (ranging from {\textless}1\% of those younger than 20 years to approximately 20\% of those aged 70 years or older). We estimated 6\% (3–12) of males to be at high risk compared with 3\% (2–7) of females. The share of the population at increased risk was highest in countries with older populations, African countries with high HIV/AIDS prevalence, and small island nations with high diabetes prevalence. Estimates of the number of individuals at increased risk were most sensitive to the prevalence of chronic kidney disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic respiratory disease. About one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19, should they become infected, due to underlying health conditions, but this risk varies considerably by age. Our estimates are uncertain, and focus on underlying conditions rather than other risk factors such as ethnicity, socioeconomic deprivation, and obesity, but provide a starting point for considering the number of individuals that might need to be shielded or vaccinated as the global pandemic unfolds.},

While racial disparities in cumulative incidence (CmI) and mortality from the influenza pandemics of 1918 and 2009 implicated Blacks with survival disadvantage relative to Whites in the United States, COVID-19 currently indicates comparable disparities. We aimed to: (a) assess COVID-19 CmI by race, (b) determine the Black\&ndash;White case fatality (CF) and risk differentials, and (c) apply explanatory model for mortality risk differentials. Methods: COVID-19 data on confirmed cases and deaths by selective states health departments were assessed using a cross-sectional ecologic design. Chi-square was used for CF independence, while binomial regression model for the Black\&ndash;White risk differentials. Results: The COVID-19 mortality CmI indicated Blacks/AA with 34\% of the total mortality in the United States, albeit their 13\% population size. The COVID-19 CF was higher among Blacks/AA relative to Whites; Maryland, (2.7\% vs. 2.5\%), Wisconsin (7.4\% vs. 4.8\%), Illinois (4.8\% vs. 4.2\%), Chicago (5.9\% vs. 3.2\%), Detroit (Michigan), 7.2\% and St. John the Baptist Parish (Louisiana), 7.9\%. Blacks/AA compared to Whites in Michigan were 15\% more likely to die, CmI risk ratio (CmIRR) = 1.15, 95\% CI, 1.01\&ndash;1.32. Blacks/AA relative to Whites in Illinois were 13\% more likely to die, CmIRR = 1.13, 95\% CI, 0.93\&ndash;1.39, while Blacks/AA compared to Whites in Wisconsin were 51\% more likely to die, CmIRR = 1.51, 95\% CI, 1.10\&ndash;2.10. In Chicago, Blacks/AA were more than twice as likely to die, CmIRR = 2.24, 95\% CI, 1.36\&ndash;3.88.

In particular, the test distribution across income levels is significantly more egalitarian than the distribution of income itself: The ten percent of the city's population living in the richest zip codes received 11 percent of the Covid-19 tests and 29 percent of the city's income. The ten percent of the city's population living in the poorest zip codes received 10 percent of the tests but only 4 percent of the city's income. At the same time, we find significant disparity in the fraction of tests that come back negative for the Covid-19 disease across income levels: moving from the poorest zip codes to the richest zip codes is associated with an increase in the fraction of negative Covid-19 test results from 38 to 65 percent.},

We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter’s integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January 1–April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African American patients had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option. Our study provides real-world evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the presentation of COVID-19.},

There are currently some data on disparities between African American and Caucasian populations for COVID-19 infection and mortality. While health care authorities are reorganizing resources and infrastructure to provide care for symptomatic COVID-19 patients, they should not shy away from protecting the general public as a whole and specifically the most vulnerable members of society, such as the elderly, ethnic minorities, and people with underlying comorbidities.},

We find that food insecurity rates and related measures of food hardship are elevated for all groups, and there is some evidence they have improved in recent weeks among White households. We also explore additional household economic measures and find that substantial shares—especially among Blacks and Hispanics—are worried about their incomes and ability to afford the goods they need over the next four weeks. Together, these indicators paint a picture of substantial and disparate economic hardship during the COVID-19 era.},

Black adults in every age group were more likely than whites to have health risks associated with severe COVID-19 illness. However, whites were older on average than blacks. Thus, when all factors were considered, whites tended to be at higher overall risk compared to blacks, with Asians and Hispanics having much lower overall levels of risk compared to either whites or blacks. We explored additional explanations for COVID-19 disparities, namely differences in job characteristics and how they interact with household composition. Blacks at high risk of severe illness were 1.6 times as likely as whites to live in households containing health-sector workers. Among Hispanic adults at high risk of severe illness, 64.5 percent lived in households with at least one worker who was unable to work at home, versus 56.5 percent among blacks and only 46.6 percent among whites.

	abstract = {Background
Differentials in COVID-19 hospitalisations and mortality according to ethnicity have been reported but their origin is uncertain. We examined the role of socioeconomic, mental health, and pro-inflammatory factors in a community-based sample.
Methods
We used data on 340,966 men and women (mean age 56.2 years) from the UK Biobank study, a prospective cohort study with linkage to hospitalisation for COVID-19. Logistic regression models were used to estimate associations between ethnicity and hospitalisation for COVID-19.
Results
There were 640 COVID-19 cases (571/324,306 White, 31/4,485 Black, 21/5,732 Asian, 17/5,803 Other). Compared to the White study members and after adjusting for age and sex, Black individuals had over a 4-fold increased risk of COVID-19 infection (odds ratio; 95\% confidence interval: 4.32; 3.00–6.23), and there was a doubling of risk in the Asian group (2.12; 1.37, 3.28) and the ‘other’ non-white group (1.84; 1.13, 2.99). After controlling for potential explanatory factors which included neighbourhood deprivation, household crowding, smoking, body size, inflammation, glycated haemoglobin, and mental illness, these effect estimates were attenuated by 33\% for Blacks, 52\% for Asians and 43\% for Other, but remained raised for Blacks (2.66; 1.82, 3.91), Asian (1.43; 0.91, 2.26) and other non-white groups (1.41; 0.87, 2.31).
Conclusions
There were clear ethnic differences in risk of COVID-19 hospitalisation and these do not appear to be fully explained by measured factors. If replicated, our results have implications for health policy, including the targeting of prevention advice and vaccination coverage.},

Due to inadequate research on geographic modeling of COVID-19, we investigated county-level variations of disease incidence across the continental United States. We compiled a geodatabase of 35 environmental, socioeconomic, topographic, and demographic variables that could explain the spatial variability of disease incidence. Further, we employed spatial lag and spatial error models to investigate spatial dependence and geographically weighted regression (GWR) and multiscale GWR (MGWR) models to locally examine spatial non-stationarity. The results suggested that even though incorporating spatial autocorrelation could significantly improve the performance of the global ordinary least square model, these models still represent a significantly poor performance compared to the local models. Moreover, MGWR could explain the highest variations (adj. R2: 68.1\%) with the lowest AICc compared to the others. Mapping the effects of significant explanatory variables (i.e., income inequality, median household income, the proportion of black females, and the proportion of nurse practitioners) on spatial variability of COVID-19 incidence rates using MGWR could provide useful insights to policymakers for targeted interventions.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Heightened COVID-19 mortality among Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic communities (relative to white non-Hispanic) is well established. This study aims to estimate the relative contributions to fatality disparities in terms of differences in SARS-CoV-2 infections, diagnoses, and disease severity.
Methods
We constructed COVID-19 outcome continua (similar to the HIV care continuum) for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults in New York State. For each stage in the COVID-19 outcome continua (population, infection experience, diagnosis, hospitalization, fatality), we synthesized the most recent publicly available data. We described each continuum using overall percentages, fatality rates, and relative changes between stages, with comparisons between race and ethnicity using risk ratios.
Results
Estimated per-population COVID-19 fatality rates were 0.03\%, 0.18\%, and 0.12\% for white non-Hispanic, Black non-Hispanic, and Hispanic adults, respectively. The 3.48-fold disparity for Hispanic, relative to white, communities was explained by differences in infection experience, whereas the 5.38-fold disparity for non-Hispanic Black, relative to white, communities was primarily driven by differences in both infection experience and in the need for hospitalization, given infection.
Conclusions
These findings suggest the most impactful stages on which to intervene with programs and policies to build COVID-19 health equity.},

	abstract = {Importance: Certain individuals, when infected by SARS-CoV-2, tend to develop the more severe forms of Covid-19 illness for reasons that remain unclear. Objective: To determine the demographic and clinical characteristics associated with increased severity of Covid-19 infection. Design: Retrospective observational study. We curated data from the electronic health record, and used multivariable logistic regression to examine the association of pre-existing traits with a Covid-19 illness severity defined by level of required care: need for hospital admission, need for intensive care, and need for intubation. Setting: A large, multihospital healthcare system in Southern California. Participants: All patients with confirmed Covid-19 infection (N = 442). Results: Of all patients studied, 48\% required hospitalization, 17\% required intensive care, and 12\% required intubation. In multivariable-adjusted analyses, patients requiring a higher levels of care were more likely to be older (OR 1.5 per 10 years, P{\textless}0.001), male (OR 2.0, P = 0.001), African American (OR 2.1, P = 0.011), obese (OR 2.0, P = 0.021), with diabetes mellitus (OR 1.8, P = 0.037), and with a higher comorbidity index (OR 1.8 per SD, P{\textless}0.001). Several clinical associations were more pronounced in younger compared to older patients (Pinteraction{\textless}0.05). Of all hospitalized patients, males required higher levels of care (OR 2.5, P = 0.003) irrespective of age, race, or morbidity profile. Conclusions and relevance: In our healthcare system, greater Covid-19 illness severity is seen in patients who are older, male, African American, obese, with diabetes, and with greater overall comorbidity burden. Certain comorbidities paradoxically augment risk to a greater extent in younger patients. In hospitalized patients, male sex is the main determinant of needing more intensive care. Further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying these findings.},

National maps with county-level data and an interactive scatterplot of COVID-19 cases were generated.{\textless}bold{\textgreater}Results: {\textless}/bold{\textgreater}Nearly ninety-seven percent of disproportionately black counties (656/677) reported a case and 49\% (330/677) reported a death versus 81\% (1987/2,465) and 28\% (684/ 2465), respectively, for all other counties. Counties with higher proportions of black people have higher prevalence of comorbidities and greater air pollution. Counties with higher proportions of black residents had more COVID-19 diagnoses (RR 1.24, 95\% CI 1.17-1.33) and deaths (RR 1.18, 95\% CI 1.00-1.40), after adjusting for county-level characteristics such as age, poverty, comorbidities, and epidemic duration. COVID-19 deaths were higher in disproportionally black rural and small metro counties. The PAF of COVID-19 diagnosis due to lack of health insurance was 3.3\% for counties with {\textless}13\% black residents and 4.2\% for counties with {\textgreater}13\% black residents.{\textless}bold{\textgreater}Conclusions: {\textless}/bold{\textgreater}Nearly twenty-two percent of US counties are disproportionately black and they accounted for 52\% of COVID-19 diagnoses and 58\% of COVID-19 deaths nationally. County-level comparisons can both inform COVID-19 responses and identify epidemic hot spots. Social conditions, structural racism, and other factors elevate risk for COVID-19 diagnoses and deaths in black communities.},

	abstract = {Purpose
A key to better understanding the influence of the place of residence on cardiometabolic function is the effect of concomitant exposure to both air pollution and residence in economically marginalized areas. We hypothesized that, among adolescents, the association between air pollution and cardiometabolic function is exacerbated among residents of economically marginalized areas.
Methods
In this cross-sectional study, individual-level data on cardiometabolic function collected from a representative sample of U.S. adolescents in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (n = 10,415) were merged with data on area-level poverty (U.S. decennial survey and American Community Survey) and air pollution levels (National-Scale Air Toxics Assessment ) using contemporary census-tract identifiers. We excluded respondents who were pregnant, had hypertension or diabetes or using medication for hypertension or diabetes, or with missing data on outcome variables.
Results
We observed a significant interaction between area-level poverty and air pollution. Among residents of high-poverty areas, exposure to high levels of air pollution predicted a 30\% elevated odds of cardiometabolic dysfunction (OR = 1.30; 95\% CI: 1.04, 1.61), whereas in low-poverty areas, exposure to high levels of air pollution was not associated with elevated odds of cardiometabolic dysfunction (OR = 1.04; 95\% CI: 0.85, 1.28).
Conclusions
Our findings suggest that the cardiometabolic consequences of air pollution are more readily realized among residents of economically marginalized areas. Structural remedies are discussed.},

	abstract = {Introduction
Because of their inability to access adequate medical care, transportation, and nutrition, socially vulnerable populations are at an increased risk of health challenges during disasters. This study estimates the association between case counts of COVID-19 infection and social vulnerability in the U.S., identifying counties at increased vulnerability to the pandemic.
Methods
Using Social Vulnerability Index and COVID-19 case count data, an ordinary least squares regression model was fitted to assess the global relationship between COVID-19 case counts and social vulnerability. Local relationships were assessed using a geographically weighted regression model, which is effective in exploring spatial nonstationarity.
Results
As of May 12, 2020, a total of 1,320,909 people had been diagnosed with COVID-19 in the U.S. Of the counties included in this study (91.5\%, 2,844 of 3,108), the highest case count was recorded in Trousdale, Tennessee (16,525.22 per 100,000) and the lowest in Tehama, California (1.54 per 100,000). At the global level, overall Social Vulnerability Index (eβ=1.65, p=0.03) and minority status and language (eβ=6.69, p{\textless}0.001) were associated with increased COVID-19 case counts. However, on the basis of the local geographically weighted model, the association between social vulnerability and COVID-19 varied among counties. Overall, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 infection.
Conclusions
Large-scale disasters differentially affect the health of marginalized communities. In this study, minority status and language, household composition and transportation, and housing and disability predicted COVID-19 case counts in the U.S. Addressing the social factors that create poor health is essential to reducing inequities in the health impacts of disasters.},

Finally, we suggest several strategic actions in three focal areas—environment, occupation, and housing—that can be taken by health educators working in partnership with community members, researchers, and decision makers, using, for example, a community-based participatory research approach, to reduce adverse impacts of COVID-19 and promote long-term equity in health.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic brings to the forefront the complex interconnected dilemmas of globalization, health equity, economic security, environmental justice, and collective trauma, severely impacting the marginalized and people of color in the United States. This lack of access to and the quality of healthcare, affordable housing, and lack of financial resources also continue to have a more significant impact on documented and undocumented immigrants. This paper aims at examining these critical issues and developing a framework for family therapists to address these challenges by focusing on four interrelated dimensions: cultural values, social determinants of health, collective trauma, and the ethical and moral responsibility of family therapists. Given the fact that family therapists may unwittingly function as the best ally of an economic and political system that perpetuates institutionalized racism and class discrimination, we need to utilize a set of principles, values, and practices that are not just palliative or after the fact but bring forth into the psychotherapeutic and policy work a politics of care. Therefore, a strong call to promote and advocate for the broader continuum of health and critical thinking preparing professionals to meet the challenges of health equity, as well as economic and environmental justice, are needed. The issues discussed in this paper are specific to the United States despite their relevance to family therapy as a field. We are mindful not to generalize the United States' reality to the rest of the world, recognizing that issues discussed in this paper could potentially contribute to international discourse.

As COVID-19 proliferated across the United States, Asian Americans reported a surge in racially motivated hate crimes involving physical violence and harassment. Throughout history, pandemic-related health crises have been associated with the stigmatization and “othering” of people of Asian descent. Asian Americans have experienced verbal and physical violence motivated by individual-level racism and xenophobia from the time they arrived in America in the late 1700s up until the present day. At the institutional level, the state has often implicitly reinforced, encouraged, and perpetuated this violence through bigoted rhetoric and exclusionary policies. COVID-19 has enabled the spread of racism and created national insecurity, fear of foreigners, and general xenophobia, which may be related to the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic. We examine how these crimes – situated in historically entrenched and intersecting individual-level and institutional-level racism and xenophobia – have operated to “other” Asian Americans and reproduce inequality.},

Over 1.4 million adults in the United States are currently incarcerated in state and federal prisons and over 80,000 individuals are incarcerated in local jails. Correctional settings are often deprived, overcrowded, and unsanitary environments, which do not lend themselves to the prevention, treatment, or recovery from illness. Incarcerated individuals are at a much higher risk to become infected due to a variety of factors, such as generally higher rates of chronic conditions than the community and overall lack of screening for certain illnesses.

	abstract = {This commentary amplifies the insidious nature of the novel coronavirus (resulting in COVID19) and its ubiquitous spread, which disproportionately and adversely affect the health and well-being of people of color. The consequence is poor health outcomes and premature death. Ample previous literature documents health inequities in the morbidity and mortality statistics for Black and Brown people in the United States. Their excess deaths are due to disproportionately high rates of serious health conditions (diabetes; hypertension; asthma; and lung, kidney, and heart disease), as well as structural factors having to do with income, employment, and the built environment in which they live. The health conditions are exacerbated with ongoing societal problems and stress emerging from the country's history of dehumanizing racial inequities. Current discrimination comes most virulently in the form of systematic and institutionalized racist policies that keep racial and ethnic minorities marginalized and disempowered. Furthermore, people of color encounter the immediate external pressures of working away from home and using public transportation during the country's extraordinary ongoing lockdown, heightening the risk of exposure to the virus. Moreover, the same population is overrepresented in jails and prisons where social distancing is impossible. Any virulent virus without a vaccine is bound to become a human petri dish in which people of color in the U.S. today are caught. The war against the coronavirus for people of color is part and parcel of the war to eliminate historic inequities and to level the socioeconomic playing field. This article covers the racial/ethnic inequities in morbidity and mortality from COVID19 and the slow and untimely response by the federal government to address mediation of the spread of the virus. For people of color to transcend the coronavirus pandemic crisis there must be comprehensive access to COVID-19 testing and early, sustained, and affordable access to health care, including hospitalization. Such access will require national leadership, which seems to be in short supply.},

COVID-19 outbreaks have already been identified in New York City and Cook County, Illinois, jails, with infection rates at the Rikers Island jail complex far exceeding community rates. In response, correctional systems are implementing changes to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, including reducingjail and prison admissions and releasing people from facilities. In tandem, jails and prisons must also initiate facility-level policies to help stop the spread of COVID-19.
Although some correctional entities have embraced the need for temporary reforms, many others remain opposed. This crisis reiterates the need for progressive criminal justice policy reforms- in particular, the wider adoption of compassionate release and the elimination of cash bail-and has shown that policy change is possible. Immediate action will have a positive impact on slowing the spread of COVID-19 and should become standard practice to alleviate the health harms caused by mass incarceration.},

Most SGM people are a hidden population that exists in all racial/ethnic groups. [...]recently they were invisible in the health care system. Since 2015, as part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the US government's electronic health record incentive program has encouraged the collection of SOGI data as a standard demo-graphic variable. SGM people who fall ill with COVID-19 should have access to testing and needed care. Because of discrimination, however, many SGM people do not have access to routine, preventive health care and may face increased barriers to accessing a SARS-CoV-2 test.},

Structural and practical xenophobia has driven asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants in SA to abject poverty and misery. The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) containment measures adopted by the SA government through the lockdown of the nation have tremendously deepened the unequal treatment of asylum-seekers and refugees in SA. This can be seen through the South African government’s lack of consideration of this marginalized population in economic, poverty, and hunger alleviation schemes. Leaving this category of our society out of the national response safety nets may lead to negative coping strategies causing mental health issues and secondary health concerns. An effective response to the socioeconomic challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic should consider the economic and health impact of the pandemic on asylum-seekers, refugees, and undocumented migrants.},

In Houston 77\% of Latinx households and 81\% of Black households reported serious financial issues. In New York, Los Angeles, and Chicago, rates are also substantial, with 73\%, 71\%, and 63\% of Latinx households reporting hardship. Issues reported include loss of savings, missed housing payments, and trouble paying debts, and serious childcare and child education issues in households with four children or more. 55\% of households in Chicago and 77\% in Houston also reported the pandemic has led to deleterious health consequences, as many have put of receiving care, as nationwide medical resources have been diverted to treating the pandemic. Broadly the poll shows how the impact of COVID-19 hews across racial and socioeconomic lines, with, for instance, 36\% of white New York households reporting serious financia trouble as a result of the pandemic, compared to 73\% of Latinx households.},

	abstract = {People with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, COVID-19, can have neurological problems including headache, anosmia, dysgeusia, altered mental status (AMS), ischemic stroke with or without large vessel occlusion, and Guillen-Barre Syndrome. Louisiana was one of the states hit hardest by the pandemic with just over 57,000 laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the end of June 2020. We reviewed the electronic medical records (EMR) of patients hospitalized during the peak of the pandemic, March 1st through March 31st, to document the type and frequency of neurological problems seen in patients with COVID-19 at presentation to the emergency room. Secondary aims were to determine: 1) the frequency of neurological complaints during the hospital stay; 2) whether the presence of any neurological complaint at presentation or any of the individual types of neurological complaints at admission predicted three separate outcomes: death, length of hospital stay, or the need for intubation; and 3) if the presence of any neurological complaint or any of the individual types of neurological complaints developed during hospital stay predicted the previous three outcomes. A large proportion of our sample (80 \%) was African American and had hypertension (79 \%). Out of 250 patients, 56 (22 \%) patients died, and 72 (29 \%) patients required intubation. Thirty-four (14 \%) had a neurological chief complaint at presentation; the most common neurological chief complaints in the entire sample were altered mental status (AMS) (8 \%), headache (2 \%), and syncope (2 \%). We used a competing risk model to determine whether neurological symptoms at presentation or during hospital stay were predictors of prolonged hospital stay and death. To establish whether neurological symptoms were associated with higher odds of intubation, we used logistic regression. Age was the only significant demographic predictor of death and hospital stay. The HR (95 \%CI) for remaining in the hospital for a ten-year increase in age was 1.2, (1.1, 1.3, p {\textless} 0.0001), and for death was 1.3, (1.1, 1.5, p {\textless} 0.01). There were no demographic characteristics, including age or comorbidities predictive of intubation. Adjusting for age, patients who at presentation had neurological issues as their chief complaint were at significantly increased risk for remaining in the hospital, HR = 1.7, (1.1,2.5, p = 0.0001), and dying, HR = 2.1(1.1,3.8, p = 0.02), compared to patients without any neurological complaint. Of the individual admission complaints, AMS was associated with a significantly prolonged hospital stay, HR = 1.8, (1.0-3.3, p = 0.05). Patients that required dialysis or intubation or had AMS during hospitalization had more extended hospital stays. After adjusting for age, dialysis, and intubation, patients with AMS during hospital stay had a HR of 1.6, (1.1, 2.5, p = 0.01) for remaining in the hospital. Patients who had statistically significant higher odds of requiring intubation were those who presented with any neurological chief complaint, OR = 2.8 (1.3,5.8, p = 0.01), or with headaches OR = 13.3 (2.1,257.0, p = 0.008). Patients with AMS during the hospital stay, as well as those who had seizures, were more likely to need intubation. In the multivariate model, dialysis, OR = 4.9 (2.6,9.4, p {\textless} 0.0001), and AMS, OR = 8.8 (3.9,21.2, p {\textless} 0.0001), were the only independent predictors of intubation. Neurological complaints at presentation and during the hospital stay are associated with a higher risk of death, prolonged hospital stay, and intubation. More work is needed to determine whether the cause of the neurological complaints was direct CNS involvement by the virus or the other systemic complications of the virus.

	abstract = {Objectives: There is preliminary evidence of racial and social economic disparities in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. The goal of this study is to report the associations of COVID-19 with respect to race, health, and economic inequality in the United States.; 
Methods: We performed an ecological study of the associations between infection and mortality rate of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic, and mobility variables from 369 counties (total population, 102,178,117 [median, 73,447; IQR, 30,761-256,098]) from the seven most affected states (Michigan, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, California, Louisiana, Massachusetts).; 
Results: The risk factors for infection and mortality are different. Our analysis shows that counties with more diverse demographics, higher population, education, income levels, and lower disability rates were at a higher risk of COVID-19 infection. However, counties with higher proportion with disability and poverty rates had a higher death rate. African Americans were more vulnerable to COVID-19 than other ethnic groups (1981 African American infected cases versus 658 Whites per million). Data on mobility changes corroborate the impact of social distancing.; 
Conclusion: Our study provides evidence of racial, economic, and health inequality in the population infected by and dying from COVID-19. These observations might be due to the workforce of essential services, poverty, and access to care. Counties in more urban areas are probably better equipped at providing care. The lower rate of infection, but a higher death rate in counties with higher poverty and disability could be due to lower levels of mobility, but a higher rate of comorbidities and health care access.},

Multivariate logistic regression models including age, sex and ethnicity were used to test whether addition of (1) cardiometabolic factors [diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, prior myocardial infarction, smoking and body mass index (BMI)]; (2) 25(OH)-vitamin D; (3) poor diet; (4) Townsend deprivation score; (5) housing (home type, overcrowding) or (6) behavioural factors (sociability, risk taking) attenuated sex/ethnicity associations with COVID-19 status.; Results: There was over-representation of men and BAME ethnicities in the COVID-19 positive group. BAME individuals had, on average, poorer cardiometabolic profile, lower 25(OH)-vitamin D, greater material deprivation, and were more likely to live in larger households and in flats/apartments. Male sex, BAME ethnicity, higher BMI, higher Townsend deprivation score and household overcrowding were independently associated with significantly greater odds of COVID-19. The pattern of association was consistent for men and women; cardiometabolic, socio-demographic and behavioural factors did not attenuate sex/ethnicity associations.; Conclusions: In this study, sex and ethnicity differential pattern of COVID-19 was not adequately explained by variations in cardiometabolic factors, 25(OH)-vitamin D levels or socio-economic factors. Factors which underlie ethnic differences in COVID-19 may not be easily captured, and so investigation of alternative biological and genetic susceptibilities as well as more comprehensive assessment of the complex economic, social and behavioural differences should be prioritised.

The aim of this study was to determine whether disparities exist in the levels of knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAPs) related to COVID-19.; Methods: We analyzed data from 1216 adults in the March 2020 Kaiser Family Foundation 'Coronavirus Poll', to determine levels of KAPs across different groups. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis was used to identify predictors of KAPs.; Results: In contrast to White respondents, Non-White respondents were more likely to have low knowledge (58\% versus 30\%; P {\textless} 0.001) and low attitude scores (52\% versus 27\%; P {\textless} 0.001), but high practice scores (81\% versus 59\%; P {\textless} 0.001). By multivariate regression, White race (odds ratio [OR] 3.06; 95\% confidence interval [CI]: 1.70-5.50), higher level of education (OR 1.80; 95\% CI: 1.46-2.23) and higher income (OR 2.06; 95\% CI: 1.58-2.70) were associated with high knowledge of COVID-19. Race, sex, education, income, health insurance status and political views were all associated with KAPs.; Conclusions: Racial and socioeconomic disparity exists in the levels of KAPs related to COVID-19. More work is needed to identify educational tools that tailor to specific racial and socioeconomic groups. (© The Author(s) 2020.

Limited racial data is available on a national level.; Methods: We conducted the first nationwide analysis to examine COVID-19 and race on a county level. We obtained datasets on COVID-19 cases and deaths, and racial population totals, by US county. We examined if correlations exist between the racial percentages and percentages of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths by county.; Results: A positive correlation existed between percentages of African-Americans living in a county and who have COVID-19 (r = 0.254, P {\textless} 0.0001), who have died from COVID-19 (r = 0.268, P {\textless} 0.0001), and case mortality (r = 0.055, P = 0.003). Positive correlations also existed between percentages of Asian-Americans living in counties and these factors. Negative correlations existed between percentages of Whites living in counties and these factors.; Conclusions: A weak, albeit very significant, positive relationship exists between the percentage of African-Americans living in a county and the percentage of COVID-19 confirmed cases, confirmed deaths and case mortality in the county. This is in support of many city and statewide analyses, and we urge for targeted resources towards work that further examine these racial associations. (© The Author(s) 2020.

	abstract = {Massachusetts has one of the highest cumulative incidence rates of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in the US. Understanding which specific demographic, economic, and occupational factors have contributed to disparities of COVID-19 is critical to inform public health strategies. We performed a cross-sectional study of 351 Massachusetts towns/cities (01/01/2020–05/06/2020) and found that a 10 percentage point increase in the Black population was associated with a 312.3 increase in COVID-19 cases per 100,000, while a 10 percentage point increase in the Latino population was associated with an increase of 258.2 cases per 100,000. Independent predictors of higher COVID-19 rates included the proportion of foreign-born non-citizens living in a community, mean household size, and share of food service workers. After adjustment for these variables, the association between the Latino population and COVID-19 rates was attenuated. In contrast, the association between the Black population and COVID-19 rates persisted, and may be explained by other systemic inequities. Public health and policy efforts that improve care for foreign born non-citizens, address crowded housing, and protect food-service workers may help mitigate the spread of COVID-19 among minority communities. [Editor’s Note: This Fast Track Ahead Of Print article is the accepted version of the peer-reviewed manuscript. The final edited version will appear in an upcoming issue of Health Affairs.]
CONCLUSION
Across Massachusetts cities and towns, significant COVID-19 disparities are evident along multiple dimensions—particularly race/ethnicity, foreign-born non-citizen status, household size, and job type. Higher proportions of Black or Latino residents within a community was significantly associated with higher rates of COVID-19 cases. The factors examined in our study explained this relationship for Latino communities but did not appear to explain the higher rates among black communities. Further research into the social and economic factors underlying COVID-19-related disparities and new policies to address risk factors and institutional racism will be critical to controlling the epidemic and improving health equity.},

So far, Americans are less concerned about how the new coronavirus is affecting their health, finances and local communities. Still, 27\% say the coronavirus is a major threat to their personal health, while 51\% say it is a minor threat. Only 22\% says it does not threaten their personal health.

Underscoring the rapidly changing nature of this crisis, the shares of Americans who say the COVID-19 outbreak is a major threat to the economy and other aspects of life increased substantially over the past week. For example, in interviews conducted March 10-11, 42\% of the public said the coronavirus was a major threat to the health of the U.S. population; in interviews conducted March 14-16, 55\% say it is a major threat to the nation’s overall health.

The national survey by Pew Research Center – conducted March 10-16 among 8,914 adults using the Center’s American Trends Panel, in conjunction with the Center’s Election News Pathways project – finds widespread public confidence that public health officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and local government officials are doing a good job in responding to the coronavirus outbreak.},

	title = {Racial {Economic} {Inequality} {Amid} the {COVID}-19 {Crisis}},
	url = {https://www.brookings.edu/},
	abstract = {COVID-19 confronts Americans with two crises: a public health crisis and an economic crisis. The two operate together, since the public health crisis has dramatically reduced economic activity and overall spending. Moreover, this crisis has broader distributional consequences than any economic event in recent memory, altering most aspects of how we live, work, and conduct business—and in truth, who will survive. 
Across the economy and society, the distributional consequences of COVID-19 are uneven: the pandemic and its broader economic and health consequences are disproportionately impacting Black Americans. 
The outsized challenges that Black Americans are facing are a reflection of the generally diminished economic position and health status that they faced prior to this crisis. Several pre– COVID-19 economic conditions—including lower levels of income and wealth, higher unemployment, and greater levels of food and housing insecurity—leave Black families with fewer buffers to absorb economic shocks and contribute to Black households’ vulnerability to the COVID-19 economic crisis.
The interaction of those pre–COVID-19 economic and health disparities—including a higher rate of preexisting health conditions such as hypertension and lung disease— as contributed to higher COVID-19 mortality rates for Black Americans (e.g. Benitez, Courtemanche, and Yelowitz 2020; Weimers et al. 2020). According to the APM Research Lab, Black Americans continue to experience the highest overall actual COVID-19 mortality rates (80.4 per 100,000)—more than twice the rate of white Americans (35.9 per 100,000) or Asian Americans (33.1 per 100,000), who have the lowest COVID-19 mortality rates. In 2020 more Black Americans will die of COVID-19 than will succumb to diabetes, strokes, accidents, or pneumonia. In fact, COVID-19 is currently the third leading cause of death for Black Americans (APM Research Lab 2020).},

Interventions should address social inequality to achieve health equity across pandemics.},

Social inequities increase health disparities and lead to increased rates of chronic diseases, which increases the risk and severity of COVID-19.

	abstract = {As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, Black and Hispanic households have been more likely to lose income and experience difficulty making rent or mortgage payments, according to our analysis of data from the Census Bureau’s new weekly Household Pulse Survey (HPS).
Our analysis draws on data collected between May 21 and 26 in this weekly survey, which asked nearly 89,000 respondents about their social and economic situations since March 13, 2020, when lockdowns and restrictions began in many states. As discussed in our previous blog, despite its name, the HPS currently presents information on impacted individuals (not households), which may overstate the pandemic’s household-level impacts and makes it difficult to interpret some results. To address this issue, we calculated household-weights and produced household-level estimates.
Using this approach, we found that Black and Hispanic households are much more likely to have been hurt by the economic impacts of COVID-19. More than half of Hispanic (58 percent) and Black (53 percent) households experienced a decline in employment income since mid-March, much higher than the share of Asian/other ethnicity (44 percent) and white (39 percent) households.
Moreover, renters were more vulnerable than homeowners: 52 percent of all renters had lost income from employment in the past two months compared to 39 percent of all homeowners (Figure 1) and Hispanic renters were hit the hardest. Almost two in every three Hispanic renters lost employment income (64 percent), followed by Black (57 percent), Asian/other (51 percent), and white (47 percent) renters. While renters were impacted the most, many homeowners also lost income. Among homeowners, Black and Hispanic homeowners were disproportionally impacted. About half of Hispanic (53 percent) and Black (49 percent) homeowners lost employment income since mid-March, compared with 40 percent of Asian/other ethnicity and 36 percent of white homeowners.},

Especially, we propose a stage-based approach to capture how the negative sentiment changes along with the three development stages of COVID-19, under which it transformed from a domestic epidemic into an international public health emergency and later, into the global pandemic. At each stage, sentiment analysis enables us to recognize the negative sentiment from tweets with racist hashtags, and keyword extraction allows for the discovery of themes in the expression of negative sentiment by these tweets. Under this public health crisis of human beings, this stage-based approach enables us to provide policy suggestions for the enactment of stage-specific intervention strategies to combat racism and xenophobia on social media in a more effective way.},

	abstract = {The outbreak of Covid-19 has been highly racialised and stigmatised around the world based on the origin of the virus and its highly infectious nature. Profiling of Asians or mongoloid looking individuals as a suspect carrier of the virus and the resultant taunts and discriminations occur worldwide. In India, the pandemic has reinforce racism against Northeast Indians, which the country has been grappling with this social problem in the last one decade or so. Such discriminations were overt acts of racial prejudice that primarily stems from the nonrecognition or misrecognition of Northeast Indians, who are mainly mongoloid race, as Indians. During the pandemic, the fight by Northeast Indians was with the mindset of the rest of Indians as much as the virus itself. It was a fight not only against the presumption of being ‘non-Indian’ with negative affiliation, or worse ‘unwanted Indians’, but also to get due recognition and acceptance as equal Indians. The absence of stringent anti-racism laws may have resulted in the pervasiveness of overt acts of racism during the pandemic. However, such actions are best understood on the structural elements that underpin Indian societies. The legal measures to address this social problem will reduce overt acts of racism but addressing covert racial acts, which are structural in nature, is a long way to go.},

She reflects on representations of ‘the invisible enemy’: an empty category, she claims, which has been contingently filled and morally loaded, resting on pre‐existing categories, such as stereotypical representations of nations. The invisibility of ‘the enemy’ has in fact been rendered visible through what she refers to as contingent racism; this includes the ubiquitous and hence powerful use of irony and satire at the expense of China and Italy, but also expands to the use of banal and convenient tropes of accusation and derision among European Union member states, bringing back to the fore the North‐South divide and its power imbalances. The author suggests that the Covid‐19 crisis has ultimately provoked a veritable epidemic of contingent racism on multiple levels by stirring stereotypes and cultural prejudices which are rooted in time and rapidly renewed; its effect is all but contingent, and likely to accompany us far beyond the Covid‐19 crisis itself.},

This is reminiscent of the anti-African sentiment during the 2013-2016 West African outbreak of Ebola virus disease. The racism and xenophobia are not limited to the streets; incendiary rhetoric like "the Chinese virus" and "China's fault" have shamefully been adopted by some prominent public figures and fora, providing the necessary oxygen to fan the flames of hate and discrimination against members of the targeted communities.

	abstract = {The 2019 novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease COVID-19) has been spreading at an exponential rate around the world since its outbreak in Wuhan, China, in December 2019.1 As of April 4, 2020, more than 1 000 000 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in more than 150 countries, resulting in more than 50 000 deaths. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and US president Donald Trump declared a national emergency on March 13.There is no question that it is important for China and other countries to work together to stop the spread of COVID-19, and there is much to commend about the international response to the virus. That effort has to, definitionally, involve a focus on disease containment in China and in travel to and from China. However, one ofthe unintended emerging consequences of the global response to this pandemic has been increasing reports around the world of racism and xenophobia against Asian people, particularly people of Chinese descent. On social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, anti-Chinese sentiment has been growing since the virus outbreak, perpetuating the stereotype that Chinese people are unclean and disease ridden. Some news articles in the United States, Australia, and France have used racist terms such as "China virus" and "yellow alert." There were multiple incidents of hatred and violence against people of Asian descent because of COVID-19 around the world (see the Appendix, available as a supplement to the online version of this article at http://www.ajph. org). As SARS-CoV-2 infects more and more people worldwide, episodes of racism against people of Asian descent may continue to grow, potentially exacerbated by fear and disinformation about the virus.Racism is an important determinant of health. Growing research shows that racism and racial discrimination have adverse effects on both the mental and physical health of those targeted by it. However, most studies on racism in the United States have focused on African Americans, and few studies have assessed the impact of racism on population health among other racial/ethnic groups such as Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. There is no reason to suspect that racism does not have similar adverse health effects across different population groups; thus, racism directed at people of Asian descent during this outbreak should be a cause for alarm.},

The second report states clearly that factors such as racism, discrimination, and social inequality may have contributed to the increased risk of death from covid-19 among ethnic minority groups.

The report concluded: “The unequal impact of covid-19 on BAME communities may be explained by a number of factors ranging from social and economic inequalities, racism, discrimination and stigma, occupational risk, inequalities in the prevalence of conditions that increase the severity of disease including obesity, diabetes, CVD [cardiovascular disease] and asthma.”},

	volume = {19},
	doi = {10.1186/s12939-020-01242-z},
	abstract = {Background 
By mid-May 2020, there were over 1.5 million cases of (SARS-CoV-2) or COVID-19 across the U.S. with new confirmed cases continuing to rise following the re-opening of most states. Prior studies have focused mainly on clinical risk factors associated with serious illness and mortality of COVID-19. Less analysis has been conducted on the clinical, sociodemographic, and environmental variables associated with initial infection of COVID-19.
Methods
A multivariable statistical model was used to characterize risk factors in 34,503cases of laboratory-confirmed positive or negative COVID-19 infection in the Providence Health System (U.S.) between February 28 and April 27, 2020. Publicly available data were utilized as approximations for social determinants of health, and patient-level clinical and sociodemographic factors were extracted from the electronic medical record.
Results
Higher risk of COVID-19 infection was associated with older age (OR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.41–2.02, p {\textless} 0.0001), male gender (OR 1.32; 95\% CI 1.21–1.44, p {\textless} 0.0001), Asian race (OR 1.43; 95\% CI 1.18–1.72, p = 0.0002), Black/African American race (OR 1.51; 95\% CI 1.25–1.83, p {\textless} 0.0001), Latino ethnicity (OR 2.07; 95\% CI 1.77–2.41, p {\textless} 0.0001), non-English language (OR 2.09; 95\% CI 1.7–2.57, p {\textless} 0.0001), residing in a neighborhood with financial insecurity (OR 1.10; 95\% CI 1.01–1.25, p = 0.04), low air quality (OR 1.01; 95\% CI 1.0–1.04, p = 0.05), housing insecurity (OR 1.32; 95\% CI 1.16–1.5, p {\textless} 0.0001) or transportation insecurity (OR 1.11; 95\% CI 1.02–1.23, p = 0.03), and living in senior living communities (OR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.23–2.32, p = 0.001).
Conclusion
sisk of COVID-19 infection is higher among groups already affected by health disparities across age, race, ethnicity, language, income, and living conditions. Health promotion and disease prevention strategies should prioritize groups most vulnerable to infection and address structural inequities that contribute to risk through social and economic policy.},

In the experience of many African American patients struggling against terminal illness, health care providers have denied them a say in their own medical decision‐making. In the midst of the Covid‐19 pandemic, African Americans have once again been denied a say with regard to the rationing of scarce medical resources such as ventilators, in that dominant and ostensibly race‐neutral algorithms sacrifice black lives.

	abstract = {Many people from ethnic/racial minorities hold essential jobs in health and social care, retail, public transport, and other sectors, putting them on the front line and at risk of exposure to COVID-19.11,21 Some people from ethnic/racial minority groups have been segregated in overcrowded urban housing centres and workplaces, the conditions of which can make physical distancing and self-isolation difficult, leading to increasing risks for the spread of COVID-19.13,16,21 Ethnic/racial minorities exposed in crowded places and becoming seriously ill might be infected from multiple sources and a comparatively large infectious dose of the causative virus (SARS-CoV-2), which could be relevant in health and social care workers.11,13 Health-care disparities are also likely to have a role in the high burden of COVID-19 among ethnic/racial minorities—eg, in the USA, Black or African American minorities and Hispanic groups are less likely to have health insurance, with consequent reduced health-care access and use.13,21 The relevant public health messaging, early diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 among ethnic/racial minorities might be less effective, leading to later presentation.13,16,21 The important role of culture, including places of worship, multigenerational households, and variation in social interactions might also have a role in increased risks of COVID-19.13,16 These complicated social determinants of health might explain the increased risk of infection but not necessarily worse outcomes and all these factors need deeper examination before we can draw valid conclusions.

Chronic conditions, especially diabetes, are comparatively common in African and South Asian minority groups in Europe and the USA.22 Stroke is more common in African populations in the UK and the USA, with moderate increased risk of coronary heart disease in South Asian groups compared with White populations.22 Other comorbidities including COPD, asthma, and infections such as tuberculosis might also be contributing to comparatively adverse outcomes in COVID-19.

[...]the heterogeneity of ethnic/racial minority groups, whether African, Caribbean, South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, or Bangladeshi in the UK), Chinese, or other ethnicities, have diverse risk factor profiles, which might be important for COVID-19 outcomes.19,23 The high prevalence of chronic diseases in US and UK ethnic/racial minorities reflects social and economic disadvantages, and factors such as diet, cigarette smoking, alcohol use, and exposure to psychosocial stressors.16,21,22 The effects of hostile environments against immigrants, particularly failed asylum seekers and undocumented immigrants, might affect settled ethnic/racial minority populations adversely through heightened prejudice and societal tensions.

The evidence in the UK and the USA in the time of COVID-19 has sharpened the focus on inequalities neglected for a long time.

[...]hand in hand, political action is needed to tackle xenophobia and racism, with concerted efforts to resolve long-standing societal inequalities globally.},

	abstract = {Socio-economic disparities quite often have a central role in the unfolding of large-scale catastrophic events. One of the most concerning aspects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics is that it disproportionately affects people from Black and African American backgrounds creating an unexpected infection gap. Interestingly, the abnormal impact on these ethnic groups seem to be almost uncorrelated with other risk factors, including co-morbidity, poverty, level of education, access to healthcare, residential segregation, and response to cures. A proposed explanation for the observed incidence gap is that people from African American backgrounds are more often employed in low-income service jobs, and are thus more exposed to infection through face-to-face contacts, but the lack of direct data has not allowed to draw strong conclusions in this sense so far. Here we introduce the concept of dynamic segregation, that is the extent to which a given group of people is internally clustered or exposed to other groups, as a result of mobility and commuting habits. By analysing census and mobility data on more than 120 major US cities, we found that the dynamic segregation of African American communities is significantly associated with the weekly excess COVID-19 incidence and mortality in those communities. The results confirm that knowing where people commute to, rather than where they live, is much more relevant for disease modelling.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Emerging data have described poor clinical outcomes from infection with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV 2) among African American patients and those from underserved socioeconomic groups. We sought to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes of acute kidney injury (AKI) in this special population. Methods: This is a retrospective study conducted in an underserved area with a predominance of African American patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the sample population. The onset of AKI and relation to clinical outcomes were determined. Multivariate logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with AKI. Results: Nearly half (49.3\%) of the patients with COVID-19 had AKI. Patients with AKI had a significantly lower baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and higher FiO2 requirement and D-dimer levels on admission. More subnephrotic proteinuria and microhematuria was seen in these patients, and the majority had a pre-renal urine electrolyte profile. Patients with hospital-acquired AKI (HA-AKI) as opposed to those with community-acquired AKI (CA-AKI) had higher rates of in-hospital death (52 vs. 23\%, p = 0.005), need for vasopressors (42 vs. 25\%, p = 0.024), and need for intubation (55 vs. 25\%, p = 0.006). A history of heart failure was significantly associated with AKI after adjusting for baseline eGFR (OR 3.382, 95\% CI 1.121–13.231, p = 0.032). Conclusion: We report a high burden of AKI among underserved COVID-19 patients with multiple comorbidities. Those who had HA-AKI had worse clinical outcomes compared to those who with CA-AKI. A history of heart failure is an independent predictor of AKI in patients with COVID-19.},

The aim of this study is to report on the clinical characteristics and the predictors of mortality in hospitalized AA patients with COVID‐19 infection. Methods   In this retrospective cohort review, we included all AA patients with confirmed COVID‐19 infection admitted to an inner‐city teaching community hospital in New York City. Demographics, clinical presentation, baseline co‐morbidities, and laboratory data were compared between survivors and non‐survivors. The predictors of mortality were assessed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Results   Of the 408 (median age, 67years) patients included, 276(66.65\%, median age 63years) survived while 132(33.35\%, median age 71years) died. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, myalgia, fever/chills, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain), with a prevalence of 62.50\%, 43.87\%, 53.68\%, and 27.21\%, respectively. Age (OR 1.06, CI 1.04‐1.08, P‐ {\textless}0.001), body mass index (OR 1.07, CI 1.04‐1.11, P‐ {\textless}0.001), elevated serum ferritin(OR 1.99, CI 1.08‐3.66, P‐ 0.02), C‐reactive protein (OR 2.42, CI 1.36‐4.33, P‐0.01), and D‐dimers(OR 3.79, CI 2.21‐6.50, P‐ {\textless}0.001) at the time of presentation were identified as the independent predictors of mortality. Conclusions   Cough, shortness of breath, fever/chills, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgia were the predominant presentation among African‐Americans hospitalized with COVID‐19 infection. Advanced age, higher BMI, elevated serum ferritin, C‐reactive protein, and D‐dimers are independent predictors of mortality among hospitalized African‐Americans with COVID‐19 infection.},

	abstract = {In April 2020, preliminary and incomplete data released by several states and large cities indicated that African Americans were at increased risk of dying from COVID-19,1-3 highlighting deep inequalities in socioeconomic resources, health, and access to care. Some, but not all, reports indicated that infection rates were also relatively high among African Americans. In early April, Mother Jones began requesting racial and ethnic breakdowns of COVID-19 infections and deaths from health departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.2 Of those, 21 states released no racial or ethnic breakdowns of those infected by mid-April. Twentysix states did not release breakdowns of fatalities by race. Despite the inadequacy of public health surveillance data, there was reason to be deeply concerned about the disproportionate impact COVID-19 was having on African Americans. The initial reports ofpronounced ethnic disparities in COVID-19 mortality rates quickly led to concerted calls from community activists, policymakers, and lawmakers for improved public health surveillance data that provide monitoring of racial disparities in rates of infection, hospitalizations, and deaths.Epidemiological data indicate that marked racial disparities exist in confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, with higher rates among African Americans. Racial disparities are evident in all regions of the country (Table 1).1 7 Current data are preliminary and limited. Comprehensive surveillance data are urgently needed that include racial/ethnic characteristics and gender, underscoring that some US populations are disproportionately affected by COVID-19. At a later stage, differentials based on zip codes, as was done years ago for HIV in several locations, could further map population disparities in COVID-19 in greater detail.},

As states begin to lift these orders to reopen the economy, the risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 may be related to the public's voluntary adherence to public health recommendations. We conducted a nationally representative survey of 604 African Americans to generate a risk assessment based on African Americans' compliance with public health recommendations to frequently wash hands, maintain social distancing, avoid touching face, and wear a mask in public. This is, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive study of African Americans and public health adherence specific to COVID-19. The percent of respondents reporting that they always comply with these recommendations was 72\%, 67\%, 55\%, and 65\%, respectively. Based on this threshold, African Americans' level of adherence with COVID-19 public health recommendations suggests they may be at high risk of a resurgence of COVID-19 during reopening, and there is an urgent need for targeted, culturally responsive public health messaging that is accessible to communities of color to help address racial disparities in COVID-19 risk.

Clinical characteristics and outcomes of vulnerable populations, such as those with gynecologic cancer who develop COVID‐19 infections, is limited. Methods   Patients from 6 NYC‐area hospital systems with known gynecologic cancer and a COVID‐19 diagnosis were identified. Demographic and clinical outcome data were abstracted through a review of electronic medical records. Results   Records for 121 patients with gynecologic cancer and COVID‐19 were abstracted; the median age at the COVID‐19 diagnosis was 64.0 years (interquartile range, 51.0‐73.0 years). Sixty‐six of the 121 patients (54.5\%) required hospitalization; among the hospitalized patients, 45 (68.2\%) required respiratory intervention, 20 (30.3\%) were admitted to the intensive care unit, and 9 (13.6\%) underwent invasive mechanical ventilation. Seventeen patients (14.0\%) died of COVID‐19 complications. No patient requiring mechanical ventilation survived. On multivariable analysis, hospitalization was associated with an age ≥64 years (risk ratio [RR], 1.73; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.18‐2.51), African American race (RR, 1.56; 95\% CI, 1.13‐2.15), and 3 or more comorbidities (RR, 1.43; 95\% CI, 1.03‐1.98). Only recent immunotherapy use (RR, 3.49; 95\% CI, 1.08‐11.27) was associated with death due to COVID‐19 on multivariable analysis; chemotherapy treatment and recent major surgery were not predictive of COVID‐19 severity or mortality. Conclusions   The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a COVID‐19 infection is 14.0\%. Recent immunotherapy use is associated with an increased risk of mortality related to COVID‐19 infection. Lay Summary   The case fatality rate among gynecologic oncology patients with a coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) infection is 14.0\%; there is no association between cytotoxic chemotherapy and cancer‐directed surgery and COVID‐19 severity or death.
As such, patients can be counseled regarding the safety of continued anticancer treatments during the pandemic. This is important because the ability to continue cancer therapies for cancer control and cure is critical.},

To understand the emerging pattern of racial inequality in the effects of COVID-19, we examined the relative burden of social vulnerability and health risk factors. We found significant spatial clusters of social vulnerability and risk factors, both of which are significantly associated with the increased COVID-19-related death rate. We also found that a higher percentage of African Americans was associated with increased levels of social vulnerability and risk factors. In addition, the proportion of African American residents has an independent effect on the COVID-19 death rate. We argue that existing inequity is often highlighted in emergency conditions.

	abstract = {Black Lives Matter has been a major force for social change in the US since 2014, with social media playing a core role in the development and proliferation of the movement. The largest protests in US history occurred in late May and early June 2020, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. This incident reignited widespread support for the BLM movement. The protests were notable not only for their size but also that they occurred at a time the US was still struggling to control the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, with more than 20,000 new cases per day. With protest conditions and police crowd control tactics exacerbating disease spread and with COVID disproportionately affecting minority populations, it was hypothesised that participation in and support for the protests would involve a balancing act between the risks of systemic racism and of disease spread. However, social media data suggest that this was not the case, with discussion of the BLM movement replacing discussion of COVID on US social media. Neither supporters or opposers of the BLM movement or protest action mentioned COVID as a factor. Framings of the movement by BLM supporters largely replicated those of earlier studies, with new frames emerging surrounding the opposition the movement has received from racism, police militarisation and President Donald Trump. Discourse evidenced worrying levels of polarisation, hate, incivility and conspiracy content and bore many similarities to previously studied COVID discourse. This suggests that George Floyd's death, as yet another example of an African American man killed by US police, was largely seen through established, polarised identity positions that made reactions to the incident and resulting protest largely a foregone conclusion, established and articulated without reference to the ongoing pandemic.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVECoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has disproportionately impacted the African American community. This study aims to identify the risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease in African American patients.METHODSThis was a retrospective cross-sectional analysis of African American patients with COVID-19 treated between March 12 and April 9, 2020, at a single tertiary center. The primary outcome of interest was severe disease defined as those requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission.RESULTSThe study included 158 consecutive patients. The mean age was 57 years, and 61\% were women. The mean (SD) of BMI was 33.2 (8.6) kg/m2 . Overall, patients admitted to the ICU were older (62 vs. 55 years, P = 0.003) and had higher BMI (36.5 kg/m2 vs. 31.9 kg/m2 , P = 0.002). In unadjusted and adjusted analysis, the factors most associated with ICU admission in this sample were age (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 1.073; 95\% CI: 1.033-1.114), BMI (aOR: 1.115; 95\% CI: 1.052-1.182), and lung disease (aOR: 3.097; 95\% CI: 1.137-8.437).CONCLUSIONSThis study identified risk factors for severe disease in COVID-19, specifically in an African American population. Further inclusive research aimed at optimizing clinical care relevant to the African American population is critical to ensure an equitable response to COVID-19.},

To better understand these factors, we investigated racial disparities in COVID‐19 mortality among America's essential workers. Data from the American Community Survey and Current Population Survey was used to examine the correlation between the prevalence of COVID‐19 deaths and occupational differences across racial/ethnic groups and states. COVID‐19 mortality was higher among non‐Hispanic (NH) Blacks compared with NH Whites, due to more NH Blacks holding essential‐worker positions. Vulnerability to coronavirus exposure was increased among NH Blacks, who disproportionately occupied the top nine essential occupations. As COVID‐19 death rates continue to rise, existing structural inequalities continue to shape racial disparities in this pandemic. Policies mandating the disaggregation of state‐level data by race/ethnicity are vital to ensure equitable and evidence‐based response and recovery efforts.},

	url = {https://www.ncrc.org/holc-health/},
	abstract = {A study that compared 1930s maps with modern health data found greater COVID-19 risk factors in historically “redlined” neighborhoods.

KEY TAKEAWAYS
• For decades, starting at least in the 1930s, low-income and minority communities
were intentionally cut off from lending and investment through a system known as
redlining.
• Today, those same neighborhoods suffer not only from reduced wealth and greater
poverty, but from lower life expectancy and higher incidence of chronic diseases that
are risk factors for poor outcomes from COVID-19.
• Housing, economic and social policies should aim to eliminate those risks and undo
the unfair burdens of structural racism, both past and present.
KEY FINDINGS
• Greater historic redlining is related to current neighborhood characteristics, including
increased minority presence, higher prevalence of poverty and greater social
vulnerability.
• There are statistically significant associations between greater redlining and general
indicators of population health, including increased prevalence of poor mental health
and lower life expectancy at birth.
• There are statistically significant associations between greater redlining and preexisting conditions for heightened risk of morbidity in COVID-19 patients like asthma, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, kidney disease, obesity and stroke.
• On average, life expectancy at birth is lower by 3.6 years in redlined neighborhoods, when compared to the neighborhoods graded as the “best” by the HOLC.  Differences in life expectancy vary greatly among cities: from 14.7 years less in redlined neighborhoods of Rochester, New York, to a 1.3 year greater life expectancy in redlined neighborhoods of Ogden, Utah, which has experienced considerable growth and urban development since 1940.},

	abstract = {Studies have tested the claim that blacks are the last hired during periods of economic growth and the first fired in recessions by examining the movement of relative unemployment rates over the business cycle. Any conclusion drawn from this type of analysis must be viewed as tentative because cyclical movements in the underlying transitions into and out of unemployment are not examined. Using Current Population Survey data matched across adjacent months from 1989–2004, this article provides the first detailed examination of labor market transitions for prime-age black and white men to test the last hired, first fired hypothesis. Considerable evidence is presented that blacks are the first fired as the business cycle weakens. However, no evidence is found that blacks are the last hired. Instead, blacks appear to be initially hired from the ranks of the unemployed early in the business cycle and later are drawn from nonparticipation. The narrowing of the racial unemployment gap near the peak of the business cycle is driven by a reduction in the rate of job loss for blacks rather than increases in hiring.},

	abstract = {A study conducted by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition found a higher prevalence of COVID-19 risk factors  throughout neighborhoods that were historically “redlined.” Redlining, the process of withholding lending and investment from low-income and minority communities in particular neighborhoods, dating from at least the 1930s, correlates today with reduced health, greater poverty, lower life expectancy, and higher incidence of chronic disease. These, the latter two especially, are risk factors for poor outcomes for COVID-19. Historical redlining is related to present-day neighborhood characteristics including minority presence, higher occurrences of poverty, and greater social vulnerability (meaning people “have a decreased capability to withstand natural and human-created disasters because of their more limited resources”). There are statistically significant associations between greater redlining and pre-existing conditions like asthma, COPD, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, kidney disease, obesity and stroke, all of which lead to a heightened risk of morbidity in COVID-19 patients. The report aims to understand how historical processes have created and maintained social, economic and environmental conditions that give rise to poor health. The study aims to place the historical in the present, the authors writing, “The United States developed a deeply segregated society, the results of which are evident in the separation of communities we see today. Urban areas are often starkly divided by income and race. These divisions circumscribe the choices available to individuals.” The divisions also great determinants when it comes to the negative impact of COVID-19.},
