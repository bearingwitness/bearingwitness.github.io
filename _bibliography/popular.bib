We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter's integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January~1\textendash April~8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African American patients had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option. Our study provides real-world evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the presentation of COVID-19.},

The facility is built for 259 inmates but is currently housing 279, according to DOC.

Branswell and Silverman write, ``It is very possible a group of workers deemed critical in one state will not be in another. It's also very likely there could be a significant amount of jostling for places in line.'' The authors touch on the logistics of delivering a vaccine, as well as the supply chain, noting the large segment of the American population who live in rural areas. While they do not touch on race explicitly, social determinants of health and comorbidities will be a factor in determining who gets a vaccine when, two factors that disproportionally affect people of color.},

In the book, Trump admits to downplaying the virus despite briefings he received in January and Febuary detailing its lethality. On January 28th President Trump was briefed about the danger of the virus, and in a February 7th interview with Woodward, Trump intimated the same. This is in contrast to his downplaying during press conferences. When asked in particular about the "anger and the pain, particularly, Black people feel in this country," Woodward noting that he and Trump were "white, privledged," the President responded, ``No. You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn't you? Just listen to you. Wow. No, I don't feel that at all.''},

In this country, the latter typically includes African Americans and other persons of color. Residential segregation, emerging from housing policies that originated in the early 1900s, is one important example of practices and policies that have shaped the health of African American and Native American populations. The impact of these racist policies endures in urban areas. To this day, neighborhoods that were ``redlined'' for Black residents and experienced the systematic elimination of key social and economic resources face a lack of access to healthy food, a strong education, gainful employment opportunities, safe physical and social environments, and high quality health care.},

Mothers of school-age children, Black men, Black women, Hispanic men, Asian Americans, younger Americans ages 25 to 34, and people without college degrees were shown to have recovered the slowest. According to Ben Bernanke, who led the Federal Reserve through the Great Recession, ``The sectors most deeply affected by COVID-19 disproportionately employ women, minorities and lower-income workers.'' Near the end of the summer, the downturn was in large part over for the wealthy: home values and stock prices rebounded and white-collar jobs returned. Black women are facing the largest downturn, the Washington Post's data shows, having recovered only 34 percent of the jobs they lost at the outset of the pandemic.},

Go said that the strategy doesn't have anything that could put the government in a position to respond to the rise of racism, particularly anti-Chinese and anti-Asian racism during a pandemic. The strategy makes explicit reference to tackling anti-Black,anti-Indigenous, Islamaphobic, and Anti-Semitic racism and discrimination, but,Go said, more can be done to tackle the rise in incidents across the country in the past few months.},

According to Johns Hopkins, this new positive case number is 84\% higher than the rate at the beginning of this uptick in coronavirus infections in back from mid-September. According to CNN, the spike in cases follows the reopening of schools and colleges across the United States, and is also driven by small gathers, often family events, that are moving indoors as the weather cools.},

Black participants made up 7\% of the trial, but should be closer to 13\% if it is to reflect current population levels in the United States. One side effect of greater minority participation in vaccine trials, an academic researcher noted, is greater trust in the vaccine process, especially in those communities who have had historically fraught relationships with federal medical programs.},

Tsai notes that praise was lavished on German Prime Minister Angela Merkel who presided over a country of 83 million, with a \$3.9 billion GDP, and 9,300 COVID-19 deaths, and compares it to relative silence in regard to Vietnam, a country of 96 million, with a \$248 million GDP, and zero COVID-19 deaths "even in May." She calls out a New York Times article that praised the "heroics of Italian leaders\textemdash who bore responsibility for a death toll 115 times that of South Korea's count of 310 COVID-19 deaths\textemdash and focused on Western leadership without mentioning the relative summer success of countries in Africa, or the pandemic death count in Taiwan\textemdash just seven as of this writing." Tsai's final thesis is that though data has driven much of the information we have received about the virus, the data is not so much "empirical, [as they] are actually imperial."},

Fortunately, we have had time to prepare and plan." The subsequent outbreak has led to a mask mandate, requiring all inmates and deputies to wear them at the facility.
