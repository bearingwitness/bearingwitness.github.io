	abstract = {As the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic spreads throughout the United States, evidence is mounting that racial and ethnic minorities and socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are bearing a disproportionate burden of illness and death. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of COVID-19 patients at Sutter Health, a large integrated health system in northern California, to measure potential disparities. We used Sutter’s integrated electronic health record to identify adults with suspected and confirmed COVID-19, and we used multivariable logistic regression to assess risk of hospitalization, adjusting for known risk factors, such as race/ethnicity, sex, age, health, and socioeconomic variables. We analyzed 1,052 confirmed cases of COVID-19 from the period January 1–April 8, 2020. Among our findings, we observed that compared with non-Hispanic white patients, non-Hispanic African American patients had 2.7 times the odds of hospitalization, after adjustment for age, sex, comorbidities, and income. We explore possible explanations for this, including societal factors that either result in barriers to timely access to care or create circumstances in which patients view delaying care as the most sensible option. Our study provides real-world evidence of racial and ethnic disparities in the presentation of COVID-19.},

This is in contrast to his downplaying during press conferences. When asked in particular about the "anger and the pain, particularly, Black people feel in this country," Woodward noting that he and Trump were "white, privledged," the President responded, “No. You really drank the Kool-Aid, didn’t you?

She calls out a New York Times article that praised the "heroics of Italian leaders—who bore responsibility for a death toll 115 times that of South Korea’s count of 310 COVID-19 deaths—and focused on Western leadership without mentioning the relative summer success of countries in Africa, or the pandemic death count in Taiwan—just seven as of this writing."
