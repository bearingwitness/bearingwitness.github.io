title: "Bearing Witness"
---


<p><em>Bearing Witness</em> is an effort to document and interpret the events associated with the novel coronavirus epidemic in the United States as it pertains to racialized minorities.</p>

<p>Our methodology is fairly simple. Our research team has established a series of Google alerts on specific topics related to mass incarceration, social determinants of health. The timeline represents principally four types of events: data events, political events, policy events, and scientific events. The Timeline is generated using TimelineJS, an application created by the Northwestern University Knight Lab. We are also providing <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bibliography/">a full bibliography</a> to accompany the Timeline.</p>
