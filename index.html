title: "Bearing Witness"
---


<p><em>Bearing Witness</em> is an effort to document and interpret the events associated with the novel coronavirus epidemic in the United States as it pertains to racialized minorities.</p>

<p>Our methodology is fairly simple. Our research team has established a series of Google alerts on specific topics related to mass incarceration, social determinants of health. We have drawn from these to create the Timeline below. The Timeline represents principally four types of events: data events, political events, policy events, and scientific events. We are also providing <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/bibliography/">a curated Bibliography</a> of popular and scholarly publications to accompany the Timeline.</p>
